1,Daryl Morey,We are witnessing Daryl Morey flex his muscle finally now that he has actual flexibility to work with. It really does suck we were stuck with two albatross contracts in Simmons and Harris during the start of his tenure (and Embiid’s prime). It does make you wonder how things would’ve shook out if he was around right after the 2019 season.

Not only that, we have assets to work with this off season along with the cap space from the Tobi contract.

Only questionable decisions would be holding onto Doc Rivers too long and mishandling the Harden situation?

&#x200B;

Probably others GMs would have pulled the trigger on mid trade packages envolving Maxey as well, but Morey didn't, we have our Franchise Player for the post Embiid era too..

7,Daryl Morey,"Can we have a conversation about Daryl Morey? Now the general feeling towards him seems to be negative from the fanbase, but I’m not sure I agree. Hear me out.

Draft - 
2020 - FRP: Maxey, SRP: Isaiah Joe, Paul Reed
2021 - FRP: Springer, SRP: Bassey
2022 - N/A
2023 - Ricky Council III (Undrafted)

Now with limited draft picks and low draft selections, the best part of the Sixers front office under Morey has been the ability to draft. A franchise altering talent in Maxey with the 21st pick, and multiple NBA rotation pieces in the second round (Joe, Reed, Bassey, potentially Springer), as well as the undrafted Council. 2024 generally seems to be accepted as another great draft by the Sixers. 

Trades -
The first trades were to break up the horrid, disgusting team of 2019-20, where Josh Richardson was traded with a SRP for Seth Curry, as well as getting rid of the contract from the man who we don’t speak of with a first for Danny Green. Both of these trades turned out to be successful, with both players being upgrades on their replacements without giving up a ton of capital.

James Harden trade. Now, Harden may not have been all of our first choice to sign, but it’s fair to say that giving up Simmons, who in hindsight had the worst contract in the NBA, two role players and two firsts for an all star guard was a fair trade. Harden was also huge in the progression of both Tyrese& Embiid. He ultimately left because Morey did not give him the contract he seemingly promised, which was also a good thing for the franchise, Harden is not worth a max at his age with his history, and the return for the Clippers was again a fair trade when you consider the lack of leverage we had.

The only other trade of worth was Melton for Danny Green’s expiring contract whilst injured and the 23rd pick. Melton’s back troubles seem to have derailed his career from this point, but he was certainly one of the better role players under Embiid’s era the past few seasons.

Morey has had to deal with two holdups from our second best players at the time, horrible injury luck with our best player in the playoffs and has drafted and traded well during his time here.

Now I can understand the frustration so far this season with the lack of movement, but aside from overpaying for Caruso I’m not sure there are any moved that has happened so far that we should have been involved in. There is plenty of time ahead, and I think the big plan for this summer is still in play. The Sixers front office under Morey have earned our patience this summer.

9,Daryl Morey's Drafting History ,"The Sixers have the 16th and 41st pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, and out of curiosity I gathered all of the draft picks Daryl Morey has made in his career in Houston and Philadelphia. The following are the picks he made by year:

**June 28, 2007:** Selected Aaron Brooks (1st round, 26th pick) and Brad Newley (2nd round, 54th pick) in the 2007 NBA Draft.

**June 26, 2008:** Selected Nicolas Batum (1st round, 25th pick) and Maarty Leunen (2nd round, 54th pick) in the 2008 NBA Draft.

**June 24, 2010:** Selected Patrick Patterson (1st round, 14th pick) in the 2010 NBA Draft.

**June 23, 2011:** Selected Marcus Morris (1st round, 14th pick), Nikola Mirotić (1st round, 23rd pick) and Chandler Parsons (2nd round, 38th pick) in the 2011 NBA Draft.

**June 28, 2012:** Selected Jeremy Lamb (1st round, 12th pick), Royce White (1st round, 16th pick) and Terrence Jones (1st round, 18th pick) in the 2012 NBA Draft.

**June 27, 2013:** Selected Isaiah Canaan (2nd round, 34th pick) in the 2013 NBA Draft.

**June 25, 2015:** Selected Sam Dekker (1st round, 18th pick) and Montrezl Harrell (2nd round, 32nd pick) in the 2015 NBA Draft.

**June 23, 2016:** Selected Chinanu Onuaku (2nd round, 37th pick) and Zhou Qi (2nd round, 43rd pick) in the 2016 NBA Draft.

**June 22, 2017:** Selected Isaiah Hartenstein (2nd round, 43rd pick) and Dillon Brooks (2nd round, 45th pick) in the 2017 NBA Draft.

**July 29, 2021:** Selected Jaden Springer (1st round, 28th pick), Filip Petrušev (2nd round, 50th pick) and Charles Bassey (2nd round, 53rd pick) in the 2021 NBA Draft.

**June 23, 2022:** Selected David Roddy (1st round, 23rd pick) in the 2022 NBA Draft.

Some notable things about Daryl's drafting history:

* Daryl has only made 30 picks in 17 NBA seasons
* Of the 30 picks he's made, 13 were 1st round picks
* The highest pick he has ever made was pick 12, and he has only drafted higher than 16th (this year's pick) three times
* He has actually done an incredible job drafting second round players that go on to have productive careers
* Fun Fact: Sam Hinkie made 15 draft picks in just 3 years as an NBA GM

In summary, I am certain Daryl will trade away our 1st round pick for an established player and sell our 2nd round pick for cash."

12,Daryl Morey: A one-trick pony,"There’s this great moment in “Money Ball,” where after arguing with the Athletic’s manager on executing his vision, Billy Beane’s character, finally forces his hand by making several trades: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwmsSAvkzGE

Beane is so committed to his vision that he trades away, a potential rookie of the year, and other high-profile players because they don’t fit the analytics-based approach. Daryl Morey has tried again and again to portray himself as the NBA’s version of Billy Beane, a disciple, a forward-thinker, etc; but Morey’s tenure with the Sixers has demonstrated that he’s a one-trick-pony who has no vision for the team. 

Morey’s Rocket teams had a vision. We all know this. He loved to brag about his approach and how he helped revolutionize the game to 3s and layups. Here’s the thing: everyone gets this now. The Byron Scott’s of the NBA are no longer coaching (besides Monty Williams). Every team has an analytics department, every team knows they need to get up 3-point shots. Morey’s Rockets team had a clear vision, but since he came to the Sixers that has disappeared. 

Everyone likes to claim that he has been impossibly handcuffed and it’s true that inheriting a roster with such a poor roster construction limited him. Still, other teams have gotten off of bad contracts too. Nico Harrison, a Nike Executive turned GM, traded Kristaps Porzingis (obviously better than Tobias) just starting his $158 million, five-year contract and got nothing in return. Mavs received Spencer Dinwiddie and Davis Bertans' horrible contract (5 year$80,000,000). 

That trade was viewed as a massive punt by the Mavs, but Nico Harrison knew what Morey should have known that just getting Porzingis off the Mavs roster opened possibilities for the team. Harrison got off another horrible contract in Bertans in the Grant Williams trade that brought PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford to the Mavs. 

The Mavs are now on the cups of the NBA finals because Nico Harrison had a clear vision for the team. Get another ball-handler/shot-maker. Kyrie. And surround Luka with strong defenders in PJ Washington and Derrick Jones Jr. (a vet minimum guy) and get low-usage lob threats. Harrison had to overcome two bad contracts (arguably 3 in Grant Williams) just like Morey and in less time the Mavs have gotten to two Western Conference Finals. 

And for everyone who says Luka has been SO much better than Embiid in his playoff runs, so he’s easier to build around. Just look at the stats. They shoot the exact same percentage from the field in their playoff runs. Luka is way more clutch than Embiid, but Luka also has had way more margin of error than Embiid has had in his career. 

Tim Connely and the Wolves are another example of a GM having a specific vision and executing it. In an era where shooting and spacing is so important, he zagged and created this two-big lineup that pummeled Denver in the playoffs. Wolves have a clear defensive identity and have a roster filled with players that fit that vision. 

Morey’s teams on the Sixers have never seemed to have any identity at all. He makes his big move trading for Harden and then doesn’t surround him with the players he needs to be as successful as possible. Say what you want about Harden but he won two playoff games against the Celtics and Morey didn’t get him a lob threat to be successful in the non-Embiid minutes. Instead of being creative and finding new players to surround Embiid and Haren, Morey is uncreative going with PJ Tucker and Danuel House former Rockets. 

He has no vision, no creativity. Instead time and time again, unlike Billy Beane, Morey succumbs to the wants of his coach, signing over-the-hill players at the deadline or in free agency that gives into the coach’s bad habits. Doc Rivers’s Clippers teams were destroyed in the Montrez Harrel minutes against Jokic, so what does Morey do? He signs him. Doc loves going with old vets instead of developing young players, so who does Morey sign instead of letting Maxey grow? George Hill. 

And even with Nick Nurse, Morey has continued this tradition signing Kyle Lowry who ends up starting and giving the team nothing besides one game in the playoffs. 

Morey has been incapable of finding the diamond-in-the-rough type of players that can elevate this team. For a man obsessed with 3-point shooting, he has never discovered a high-volume 3-point shooter at a minimum-level salary. And not only that, he lets one get away with Isaiah Joe. It seems painfully obvious that Morey made one great trade with the Rockets in trading for James Harden and has been living off the trade ever since.

Personally, my first call would be to Atlanta. I think Murray could be gotten for one good first/two fake firsts, with salary to match and one/both of Springer and KJ. We all saw him play a few nights ago. The fit is obvious, should he buy into a role as a 3rd option here. 

Failing a Murray trade, I would try to get Bogdan Bogdanovic. He would provide so much shooting gravity and enough ball handling to tread water when Maxey hits the bench. I think he could be gotten for Springer, Morris and a 1st.

Another player I would look at if I strike out with Atlanta is Bruce Brown. His value is right around Bogi's, and allows the team to maintain flexibility this off-season since he's on a 1+1 with a team option. He's a connector like Batum, and gives us another ball handler in the non-Maxey minutes. 

I think the amount of assets you need to give up to acquire Caruso is way too steep for a non-star. We'd definitely be outbid for Lauri Markkanen or Mikal Bridges."

61,Daryl Morey's Grandmaster Plan,"After much deliberation in the media and on this sub, I think there's a pretty good indication / idea of what Morey has up his sleeve. 

The article I have linked here is a good reference for details of our cap situation. It dives deep into the numbers and explores multiple scenarios. 

Now, Morey's plan. It starts with the trade deadline, where he is almost guaranteed to take a big swing. Why is this? Because Joel Embiid is playing like the best player in the world, and he will almost assuredly need more help against the likes of Boston, Milwaukee, or Denver.

Morey: ""Ideally, we would actually use that cap space early,” he said. “That’s generally better, because then you both have the front-end flexibility and then the back-end flexibility to re-sign them, and then you can see who becomes available. So in the parlance of how teams talk, we would like to use it early if we can. In terms of acquiring the people we might re-sign or bring back early, it gives you more flexibility.”

Embiid: ""There should never be any lost seasons and I hope that they understand that and I think they understand that so like I said, the goal is to win a championship every single year. We should always do whatever it takes to put us in that situation.”

I think the answer to this riddle is Lauri Markkanen. His availability has recently become not so secret. While it was reported he will cost a significant amount, i think the Sixers can meet the price. 

He is the best combination of fit, talent, and maintaining cap flexibility. Send out Morris, Springer, Martin Jr, and all necessary draft capital for Markkanen and Dunn.

Go into the playoffs with Maxey/Melton/Tobias/Markkanen/Embiid. Hope for the best. Onto the offseason. 

Here are the numbers (and there are variations of this in the article I posted):

Embiid - 51.4m

Markkanen - 18m

Reed - 7.7m

Melton cap hold - 15.2m

Maxey cap hold - 13m

Empty roster charge - 7.7m

Total payroll - 113m

Projected salary cap - 142m

Projected cap space - 29m

This brings us to the next part of Morey's plan. Utilize your cap space. 

I belive that OG Anunoby is the only player both available, and worth spending on in the offseason. But he would have to be willing to sign a deal starting at 29m, which is about 6m less than the max that he is qualified for. The question is, is he worth 35m, and will other teams pay that? Maybe, but I think his familiarity with Nurse might offset that.

So when it's all said and done, you trade for Markannen, sign OG (29m), re-sign Oubre to the MLE (12m), then re-sign Maxey and Melton using bird rights.

So, in finality, Morey's Grandmaster Plan is to roll into 2024 (fresh off a championship) with a core of:

PG: Maxey

SG: Melton

SF: Anunoby, Oubre

PF: Markkanen

C: Embiid, Reed"
62,"Wake up babe, new Daryl Morey just dropped",
63,Are Daryl Morey's trade expectations for James Harden reasonable?,"&#x200B;

**Back in the days of the Ben Simmons hold out** and trade demand Daryl Morey was almost universally accused of having unreasonable trade expectations in return for Ben Simmons.  I tend to think it was largely true back then because Morey's plan was pretty clearly to pursue only James Harden in return for Ben Simmons.     
It was rumored for example that he had realistic return possibilities in trade discussions with Sacramento but that instead of a more reasonable demand at the time such as either Haliburton or Fox Morey outrageously demanded both Haliburton or Fox.  Now of course Ben Simmons wouldn't fetch either of those players straight up.  

So what about now with the James Harden trade demand maybe-soon-to-be-hold-out?     
**Is Morey again unreasonable?**  I'd argue, not so much this time. 

If you listen closely it sounds like DM has already accepted that the return for Harden can be something less an ***all star*** per say.  
[**https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/sixers-daryl-morey-lays-out-what-he-expects-back-in-harden-trade-good-luck-with-that**](https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/sixers-daryl-morey-lays-out-what-he-expects-back-in-harden-trade-good-luck-with-that)  


>*“James is a* ***very good player****. Right now, unfortunately, he does prefer to be somewhere else. I do have a long relationship with him, and I am attempting to honor that. If we do look at a trade, it will be for one of two things. Either* ***a player who helps us be right there like we were last year****. Up 3-2 on one of the best teams in the East, the Celtics. Obviously, we didn’t get it done, but James is one of the reasons we were up 3-2.*  
*“Or we are going to do it where we get* ***enough draft picks so we can turn those into a player who can be a running mate with Joel****. If we don’t get either* ***a very good player*** *or* ***something we can turn into a very good player,*** *then we will just not do it. If James were to turn his mind around, we would all be thrilled. But he prefers to be traded now, and we are attempting to honor that.”*  


Daryl Morey seems perfectly rational and reasonable if you take those public statements at face value on his Harden trade expectations.  
**Let's make Morey's case for Harden's trade value** this season:  


* Harden was very much a borderline all star last season, according to reports even turning down an opportunity to make all star as an injury substitute.  

* Harden led the league in assists. Uh, Harden **led the league in assists**!  

* As Morey stated its true ***James is one of the reasons we were up 3-2 on the Celtics*** in the playoffs. He's also one of the reasons they didn't past the Celtics but its true, with Harden they were *right there*.  

* James Harden averaged 21.0 points, 10.7 assists and 6.1 rebounds in 58 games in 2022-23.  

* Yes Harden is 33 but he's not 36 like Danny Green or 35 like Steph Curry or 38 like PJ Tucker or Lebron James. He played a pretty much healthy last season without excessive downtime and he was there for the playoff run, healthier in fact than Embiid I'd say by the end.  


Of course you can make the opposing case, you're trading for 1 year but then that 1 year puts the team in position to get the rest of his career.  
He could well have a couple of strong years left without needed to be ""Houston Harden"".  
This next year will clearly be the youngest Harden the league will ever see again.  
The biggest issue Morey and the Sixers have is how **Harden, like Lillard has pulled down his own trade value by OPENLY forcing the Sixers to deal with only 1 team**, leaving the franchise with no leverage.  He could have kept this destination target mostly private but his team basically has shouted to the world.  So why should the LAC offer a fair deal when there is no competition?   
Unless Harden and his team get involved and push LAC or his desired team to make a fair deal, **Morey has nothing to lose by sitting on Harden until at least the TDL and even for the entire season** because either way he's being forced to settle for cap space next season as his highest yield potential vs accepting a weak trade. "
64,Kevin Garnett chimes in on Daryl Morey,
65,Harden will show up tomorrow and give 100% in his bid for payback to Daryl Morey.,"Hear me out….My unpopular take. This is no Ben Simmons situation.

Harden has 3 things going for him which makes this scenario likely: 1) unlike Ben Simmons he is still able to ball out and be a superstar 2) Unlike Ben, he’s beloved and respected by every player on the team, most notably the MVP, and feels comfortable coming to work. 3) the players have more respect for him at this point than Morey  

Think about it, there’s one thing that he really wants, Payback on Daryl. If he comes back and the Sixers are thriving, the payback is done ✅ and Morey is the villain."

67,Dear Daryl Morey: Do Nothing,"Dear Daryl,

How are you doing? How about that win the other night? 

I’m writing to you on the internet and I hope this message gets to you.

As a long time Sixers diehard and faithful basketball observer my recommendation for the Sixers is to do NOTHING by trade deadline.

Chemistry is at an all time high and you are firing on all cylinders. For once in the last 5 years let’s not make a trade. Let’s ride it out with our pieces. Sometimes consistency and chemistry outweigh paper/ stats talent.

Take care,

Guy on internet"
68,Attention Daryl Morey;,"Dear Daryl,

How are you doing ? How about that game last night ? I wanted to get your thoughts on my thoughts on the 3-5 year plan for OUR Sixers.

1. Embiid - Keep forever / until he retires. He’s clearly morphing into a Tim Duncan / Dirk which has staying power at least until 35-38. 

2. Maxey - Supermax this guy when possible. His attitude and play are contagious. Invaluable for any future young players who will join the team. 

3. Tobias Harris - This dude needs to stay. Get him on a team friendly multi year deal. He’s a solid number 3 or 4 for the next 3-5 years. If you can’t get him on a team friendly deal mid season, you need to trade and get a good return. Look to the North, the raptors have several guys most likely walking next year. We can’t afford to have Tobias walk in FA.

4.  Melton - We need to keep this guy long term. He is a mediocre / streaky scorer who isn’t afraid of the big moments. His defense is well above average and he has a good attitude similar to maxey. Sign him to a multi year deal please. Don’t make the same mistake you did with Shake Milton.

5. Oubre Jr - Sign to a 2 year - $10 million deal. Still can’t believe we got this guy for $1mill this year. He’s going to bring a lot of demand this FA off season. Can’t afford to let his gameplay walk for nothing.

6. Pat Bev - Sign this dude to a $5mill 2 year contract asap ! Hes a hustler and love his work ethic. Gotta keep him around. He’s the black TJ McConnell that we should have never let go.

7. Roco/Morris Sr - keep but don’t resign unless vet mins next year. These guys are long and hustlers. Can’t really score consistently but they are the big bodies we will need come playoff time. Don’t trade this year. 

8. Forkan / House / 1st Rounder(s) - Package as stated above and send them away for 1 upgraded young player. The Orlando Magic are the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NBA. They will always prematurely trade away young talent.

9. Springer / Bball Paul / Mobamba - Keep for their value and potential upside. Don’t get crazy and give too big of extensions. 2 years max.

10. Big White Center - we need a back up big asap. Bball Paul is good but not the answer when Joel isn’t playing. Joel’s Achilles has always been the big white center who can stretch the floor. Why not bring in a Lopez or equivalent via picks and possibly Bball. 

11. Seth Curry / Buddy Hield - We need a guy for 3-8 minutes per game that can pick and role with Embiid when Maxey is off or on the bench. Either of the above shouldn’t demand too much to get.

12. Wells Fargo Center - not sure if you have any input or weight in the matter but whatever WE do , we should NOT move to Center City. Build a new stadium in South Philly. 

Please feel free to DM before you make any deals. I’d be glad to consult with you.

I just finished a piece where I zoom into Daryl Morey's brain a bit, particularly his use of the Sharpe Ratio in trades.

I talk about why GMs like Morey are leaning into tools like the Sharpe Ratio to cut through the trade chaos. It's like using investment strategies for basketball trades – balancing risks and rewards to hopefully come out on top.

**Zooming in on a Trade:** Essentially, Sharpe Ratios help teams weigh up the risks, like how variable a player's performance might be, against the potential rewards, such as the boost the trade could give to the team's chances of winning a championship. In my specific example, I looked at how the De'Anthony Melton trade stacked up against the other major trades from the 2022 off-season:

81,The Return of Morey the Magician,"I've been kind of down on Morey for his attempts at rehashing the Houston Rockets for a few seasons in Philly. Now that Harden is gone, I think we're going to see a whole new Daryl...which is technically the old Daryl, but you'll see what I mean.

I'm going to choose to be positive and have a little faith in his abilities in spite of my qualms. So along those lines, I'm thinking about his first massive coup: snagging Harden from the Rockets. Taking an underrated player and making them into a star. Who out there can be our high risk, high reward player? I don't watch nearly as much non-Sixers basketball as I used to, so my knowledge is limited.

I've thrown Moses Moody out there, and I think the Warriors situation is ripe to be exploited. I would even take Wiggins off their hands and hope to salvage some value from him to get the chance to watch Moody blossom. I think this idea has been floated a couple of times. 

Bring me your diamonds in the rough. Who could blossom into a 20 ppg scorer on this team next to Joel and Maxey AND their team is in a position where they're forced to sell?"

85,Nothing can ruin the vibes today,
86,Trading Joel Embiid is probably the best direction to go from here,"Seeing Miami and Boston form their own Big 3s has fully made reality set in for me. There’s quite literally no move you can make if you’re Daryl Morey to make the Sixers a title contender over those 2 aforementioned teams (when healthy). Meanwhile, James Harden is about to leave without a plan to acquire a co-star that will replace him.

I love Joel Embiid, though he’s not entirely blameless for some of the playoff flameouts. This is the issue when your front office is incompetent for almost your entire career. But because I am a huge fan and want to see him win a title one day, I truly believe the best move for both him and the Sixers, but Embiid more so, is to trade him to a team where he has the best chance to win it all. Involve a third team, if need be, so that the Sixers can get the assets to kickstart a rebuild."
87,Keith Pompey actually started watching Sixers games,
88,"[Neil_Paine] According to the regular season RAPTOR ratings from last season, the Sixers new big 3 are much better than most big 3s to win a title since 1985","Basically this chart shows that Embiid is way better than the average best player on a title team since 1985, that Paul George is around the same level of the average 2nd best player on a title team since 1985 & that Maxey is bit better than the avg 3rd best player on a title team. This could be why Daryl Morey chose to go star-hunting (because without getting another star in its harder for the Sixers on paper to be better than the average big 3).


I will say though that Maxeys would probably be a lot higher if the Sixers played him in his best position (which is at shooting guard). Maxey had a 65.1% eFG% on catch and shoot shots and a 44.3% eFG% on pull up shots last season. League-average eFG% was 54.7%. So when you think about it, with an actual point guard in Maxey would have been more efficient as he'd be taking more offball looks & less onball ones which would've boosted his RAPTOR more. Either way the Sixers big 3 statistically are much better than the big 3 of teams that won the title in recent years. Just got to make sure that's the same with the depth and this could be the year for the Sixers."
89,"OffSeason Wishlist: Dejounte Murray, Demar Derozan, Zack Collins, Tyler Smith, & Tristan Newton","**Skills over Stars**:  

The Sixers must prioritize getting players who can collapse a defense and either score or create open threes for others.  As Daryl Morey said, we need guys who can shine in the playoffs.  Therefore, I would unload the clip for Dejounte Murray, and I would also like Demar Derozan because, besides being healthier, I dont think we have to pay Derozan nearly as much as Jimmy Butler (48m, 52m) or a Paul George (48m).  Since acquiring Murray and Derozan should not eat up all of our capspace, we should also be able to re-sign our best players (Maxey, Oubre Jr., Melton & Hield) without going to far over the luxury tax.

**Trade**:  Dejounte Murray - 2FRPs, 2SRPs.  

Given the Hawks salary woes, combined with the Sixers capspace, Atlanta should want picks and no players in return.  Thanks to the James Harden trade, the Sixers have three FRPs they can trade, plus SRPs, and swaps.  Teams should want to gamble that the Sixers and Clippers will have lost their star power in three to five years.  Hopefully we can deal something like Clippers '29 and Sixers '30, so we can keep our 2024 FRP and SRP picks for....

**Draft**:  Tyler Smith, Tristan Newton.

I've been pounding the table for Tyler Smith all year, because he is the perfect power forward to put next to either Joel Embiid or Paul Reed, a fluid yet solidly built 6'11 shooter who wants nothing better than to let it fly from deep.  We can't get Lauri Markkannen, but we can get a guy who aspires to play like him.  He reminds me of former Sixer, Tim Thomas--a stretch four way before it became fashionable.

Meanwhile,  Tristan Newton is a winner, a heady player, an older college player (23yo)who could potentially contribute early in his career.  While trying to win now, we should not ignore the future, which could be very bright with prospects like Terqavion Smith, Tristan Newton, Ricky Council IV, Tyler Smith, and B-Ball Paul Reed.

**UFAs**:   Demar Derozan, Zack Collins.

Again, as we are seeing throughout the playoffs, guys who can get into the teeth of the defense and score against the best defenses or pass to open shooters are invaluable.  As much as I adore Jimmy Butler, he's owed $48m and $52m the next two years respectively, so I'd rather pay Demar Derozan 20-30m instead. Especially since Derozan stays in phenomenal shape, he played 37.8mpg in 79games this year, 70+ the last three years.  A mid-range assassin and willing passer, Derozan has never averaged less than five assists a game over his career.   I dont think other playoff teams can afford to pay him more than the Sixers can.  If he wants a ring to certify his career, he needs to come here and help Embiid.  

Zack Collins is simply better than Mo Bamba, because he can bend his knees and defend in space, and rebound out of space.  Despite his mediocre career 3pt% (33%), Collins thinks he's a sniper, which means he can play next to Joel Embiid or Paul Reed if the Sixers want or need a big lineup.  I honestly think Collins and BBall Paul can be a lethal combination off the bench.  Remember how we were all appreciating Marcus Morris' willingness to shoot while he was here?  I want Tyler Smith because I firmly believe he will become better than Zach Collins.  But until then, we need a floor spacing big like Collins who can play some defense and has a little chip on his shoulders as well.  

**Retain**: Tyrese Maxey, Kelly Oubre Jr., Deanthony Melton, Buddy Hield, Nic Batum, Robert Covington 

Obviously, Tyrese Maxey comes back.  I want Kelly Oubre Jr. back.  But to win a championship, we have to bring back both of our knockdown shooters, Deanthony Melton and Buddy Hield.  Neither Batum nor Covington should cost that much, I don't think.

**Walk**:   Tobias Harris, Kyle Lowry, Mo Bamba, Kenyon Martin Jr,, Cameron Payne.

No explanation needed.

............................................................................................................................................................

***Dejounte Murray, Tyrese Maxey, Kelly Oubre Jr., Demar Derozan, Joel Embiid***

***Deanthony Melton, Buddy Hield, Nicolas Batum, Robert Covington, Paul Reed***

***Terqavion Smith, Tristan Newton, Ricky Council IV, Tyler Smith, Zack Collins***

I am not very much concerned about having a veteran backup point guard, because one of either Maxey or Murray should be on the floor at all times.  And with a healthy Embiid dominating like last year, we can give whole 4th quarters to Terqavion Smith and the boyz."
90,One More Morey Move in the Bag…do we extend KJ or renounce for Highsmith?,"The cap nerds have understood the benefits of extending KJ Martin above the cap for a while now.

BUT, if Caleb was forced to take a substantial pay cut this offseason that means there are going to be more decent players on the cheap. Interesting enough, if KJ’s rights are renounced Daryl can offer a contract a bit above the vet minimum with ~$5M…what if he swipes not just Caleb, but Highsmith as well from Miami? 

This would rule out going after a big contract at the deadline (like DFS) but you lock in a very strong 8 man rotation at the beginning. You can use Mook or another minimum contract to trade for someone on a rookie deal at the deadline (like Aldama). Or if there’s a ~$10M player with trading for you can use Drummonds deal if it’s absolutely worth it.

It’s not as glamorous  as giving KJ a $5M contract (the ~$15M+ contracts I’ve been seeing are ridiculous and not happening, we’re not going past the first apron before the deadline), but this could still be a realistic way to round out the roster since you can never rule out Josh Harris penny pinching some (this will anger some of you but you best believe he’s gonna have morey preach the sins of the 1st apron in an effort to minimize his luxury tax bill)."
91,What are you guys thoughts on this?,"Also do you guys think we will finally trade him by the deadline? Because Daryl Morey did call Tobias Harris a ""winning player"" in his press conference to start the season aswell as in interviews too..."
92,If the Sixers lose this series and go home early… key takeaways ?,"It’s nearly impossible to come back when down 0-2 according to statistics. Sixers have less than a 7% chance of winning this series.

The series should at minimum be 1-1 arguably 2-0 but the Sixers can’t control corrupt refs. 

Assuming the worst and the season ends in the next few days what are you key takeaways from the season?

Mine are the following:

1. Embiid and Maxey are IT . Run this duo for the next 3-4 seasons strong 

2. Tobias Harris has got to go. NO if ands or buts. 

3. Oubre should be resigned 

4. Buddy Hield stays on a team friendly contract or goes 

5. Lowry , same as Hield.

6. Nick Nurse is a good coach. Sixers were 3-4 games out of 2nd place in the East with injuries galore this year. 

*7. Most important - Daryl Morey needs to get the core group of the roster situated prior to the beginning of the season. It’s tough to create a championship team at the trade deadline and expect to win that year. Just doesn’t happen. "

But they had not.

>Despite the Sixers indicating that they would accept an offer of a Clippers’ unprotected first-round pick, first-round pick swap, players to match the salaries and Mann, two people involved in the negotiations say Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank reiterated the team’s stance that Mann would not be part of their offer. Morey, those people say, expressed his disbelief and accused the Clippers of being “unserious” about getting a deal done. He even quipped that they should just trade Clippers star Paul George for Harden if they were so determined to keep all of their lesser assets — a request that was immediately denied.

Cap Space w/ only JMcCain, PG, RCouncil	$11,950,000
Cap Space w/ only PG and RCouncil   $15,980,000

How best do the fill out the roster from there?  Obviously they will have the room exception as well.  I'm assuming they keep Council because his option is only a few hundred thousand less than the empty roster spot. 

One point on Reed - they can guaranteed his contract and then trade him for twice as much as he makes.  I could see a trade for Dorian Finney-Smith being an option there.  (https://www.libertyballers.com/2024/6/14/24177445/2024-nba-free-agency-sixers-cap-space-paul-reed-contract-daryl-morey).

108,How did Joel Embiid go +89 against the Raptors in 2019?,"I was looking back at the infamous series from 2019 in the playoffs and was looking at the +/- numbers of the Sixers players after Embiid's numbers this postseason.

  
Our main nine rotation players had +/- numbers of:

Embiid: +89

Butler: +15

Redick: -2

Mike Scott: -4

Simmons: -16

Ennis III: -21

Monroe: -25

Tobias: -33

  
Surely that has got to be some kind of record for the largest +/- in a losing series. How do you go +89 when your team loses the series by 19 points? I know we had bench problems then but there wasn't even one starter remotely close to him. It was also probably Embiid's worst offensive playoff series ever so was his defense impactful to such a high level that we couldn't function with him off the court?"

110,Klay Thompson,"I don't really understand the anti Klay Thompson sentiment especially if his cap number ends up being much lower than maxing other free agents. The JJ Reddick and Embiid dribble handoff sets worked so well back in the day and the main issue with JJ was his defense being completely unplayable in the playoffs something that although Klay has lost a step he's still not at a point where he's a liability on that end. The idea of grabbing Klay, KCP and building out around our core while keeping tradeable contracts and all our picks for the next available star to ask out seems like a very viable option, especially with reports leaking about Morey wanting to prioritize 3-point shooting this offseason just imagine if we had someone like klay standing in the corner all those years instead of Tobias who has no ability to get a 3 point shot off. A line up of Maxey, KCP, Klay, Oubre, and Embiid is fully switchable with the best spacing and shooting surrounding Embiid in his career."
111,Y'all remember...,"It took years, 2MVPs, and multiple 2nd/1st round exists until Jokic finally got his ring.

This season, Embiid finally got his Murray, and his NBA coach.  This off-season will be the first time Morey isn't tied down by baggage of any previous era before him, and he can keep focusing on building an Embiid(and now Maxey)-centric team."

115,How much worse is this (Embiidless) team as it stands now compared to the fairly deep playoff run in 2012 and why?,"This is something I've been thinking about lately and it kind of bugs me.  Twelve years later, the best post-Iverson moment in Sixers history is still Iggy draining those free throws and knocking the Bulls out of the playoffs.  Sure, you could say that only happened because of injuries, and you'd have a pretty strong point.  Problem there though is we then went on to take the Celtics to 7 games and only lost going to the ECF by 10 points, coming off a near .500 season. Putting that into perspective, we lost by 24 last year. 

Team highlights from that season: Lou Will was team points leader at 15ppg.  Jrue, Iggy and Thad Young were each averaging about 13 points per game that season. Elton Brand had 11, and the rest of the team posting sub-10 ppg.  Iggy was an elite defender.  Only Jrue & Iggy shot above average from the three (38 & 39%), and only Lou and Meeks shot average at 35-36%.  Almost everyone else on the roster was shooting under 30%. 

Now without Embiid we have Maxey at 26ppg, shooting 37.2% from the 3. Oubre posting 15 ppg. Batum shooting 39.6%, Mo Bamba shooting 42.9%, Paul Reed 36.5%, Cam Payne 35%, Kyle Lowry 35.7%, Buddy Hield 39.6% and 13 ppg, KJ Martin 35%, and Ricky Council, whom by all accounts should be getting all of KJ's minutes for the energy, defense and momentum changing he brings to both teams (Seriously, dude is averaging 6 ppg on 9mppg. Why he is not getting all of KJ's minutes is beyond me). Tobias has been largely awful, but you can at least count on him to get you 2012 Iggy/Jrue/Thad numbers 75% of the time, and every 5 games or so he shows up big. 

Point is, this team without Embiid, RoCo and Melton, is still at least as good and probably better than that 2012 squad who almost went to the ECF, yet we have zero hope.  Why?  What is different?  Is Doug Collins a better coach than Nick Nurse? Has the game evolved so much in 12 years that you can't compare that era of basketball to this era of basketball? Three point shot not as important to the game back then?  Shortened season have something to do with it maybe? 

TLDR:  We were worse in 2012 than we are right now without Embiid, and we almost went to the ECF then.  Maxey, Oubre, Buddy and Tobias overall are better than 2012 Iggy, Jrue, Lou Will and Thad Young. Our 3 point shooting in 2012 was abysmal, and it's good this year. Ricky Council is a game changer and needs more minutes.  We're getting the 8 seed. "
116,Luck of the sixers,"Winning a chip, or even making a deep run, requires a heavy amount of luck to go your way. Sixers have been the least lucky consistently contending franchise over the past 10 years.

Getting Paul George however required incredible luck.

- the new CBA has been brutal for many contending teams. Somehow we are one of the few teams benefiting from fear of the second apron

- the Warriors saw that Clips were at risk of letting PG walk, and made a good offer. But they were not willing to offer Kuminga, because they thought the Clips wouldn’t be willing to let PG walk for nothing

- the Clips have been the Dubs’ bitch for much of past 10 years, and hate them. Out of spite, they say fuck off we can maybe still convince PG to stay despite knowing they can’t give him what they want

- PG says nah you know I want 4 years. The Clips are so fearful of the second apron that they have to let him walk. We are the one of two realistic teams with cap space, and we happen to be the perfect basketball fit for him

I have the same fears of age and injury that many of us do. But let’s appreciate the stroke of very good luck that happened here. We are having the best offseason in the league right now. PG is a perfect bball fit, Eric Gordon can still nail long bombs, McCain might be our next great movement shooter, and Drumm is gonna massacre that six-four fuck Hart on the boards next April. Not to mention we have 2 picks from the wretched franchise that got rawdogged the hardest in this deal

Maybe our luck is turning— let’s take deep breaths and enjoy this!"
117,Who are your top 5 Sixers players ever and in what order?,Also where would Embiid rank if he won the chip & FMVP this season in your eyes?
118,A little bit of philosophy as we approach the trade deadline.,"All I can think of every time someone suggests that we can't risk overpaying either in a trade, or to the guys we trade for."
119,How long will it take for nurse to give up on Morris?,"I thought Nurse liked to play long athletic guys but for whatever reason he’s giving a ton of respect to Marcus Morris who can’t do nothing but take open jumpers. I mean are we gonna have a repeat of Doc again where we play a shit veteran for half the season? I mean did one game where Morris hit a few open jumpers really offset the 5 putrid games he had in a row, and the game that served has irrefutable evidence that he couldn’t play center? Why do it again tonight and give yourself no chance at the game?"
120,"[Hudrick] Tyrese Maxey, Daryl Morey and Josh Harris.",
121,"Shoutout to Tobias for staying mature, keeping his head down and sacrificing each year despite being in trade talks every single season since he signed that contract",Man is having a great start to the season and thriving in the 3rd option role again. Tobias appreciation post even if he gets traded later in the season he deserves some respect

125,"5 long years, $180 million dollars - Tobias Harris' contract has expired",
126,Worst case scenario,"I woke up this morning and read more b.s. about Joel being traded. This got me thinking. If Joel did get traded, how many of you guys would take the day off and just lay in bed? Also, what would your excuse be to not go in?"
127,Jaden Springer Meet & Greet,"Ticket rep just called and added me to a list for a Jaden Springer meet & greet after the game tonight. I figure it’ll be nothing more than a handshake, photo op, and about 3-6 seconds to ask a question. Can anyone help me think of something fun to ask him?"
128,My Therapist Gave me this signed pictures back in 2011,My therapist somehow knew Doug collins and knew I was big sixers fan. Asked me one day who my favorite players where and I told her Jrue holiday and Elton Brand. My next time I saw her she game me these. I thought I lost them when I moved houses but recently found them. They are now displayed in my house.
129,The only reason myteam is remotely fun.,I love building a sixer team.
130,This man holding Muriel is the General Manager of a 3 billion dollar company. Don't let anyone stop you from reaching new heights.,Just saw a clip from the 2002 All Star Game & Cartoon Network crossover and it made me laugh. I haven't seen it since I was a kid.
