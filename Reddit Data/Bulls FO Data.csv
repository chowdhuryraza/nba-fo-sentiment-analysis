1,CHGO Bulls Podcast: What Arturas Karnisovas can learn from Ryan Poles and the Bears rebuild,"A good listen this week. TBH, if AK is operating with only a few years left on his contract will he actually be motivated to build for the future? It shouldn’t matter IMO and ownership should support righting the ship. 

It’s past time to hold onto overvalued assets and make hard decisions that will make the Bulls better. Otherwise, what’s the point? I don’t mean championship or bust either. 

The Bulls currently aren’t a good basketball team and they lack top end talent."

Edit: Late tidbit I thought was interesting:

- [Something that stuck out from Artūras – essentially said luxury tax/cap wasn't a factor for deadline decision: ""Those conversations are at the end of the season.

3,Arturas Karnisovas - The Worst GM In Bulls History,"Let's go down memory lane and look at all of his major moves since he became VP of Basketball Ops on April 13 2020.

Sep 22 2020 - Hired Billy Donovan as head coach.

Nov 18 2020 - Drafted Patrick Williams 4th overall in 2020 NBA Draft. Also drafted Marko Simonovic 44th overall.

Mar 25 2021 - Traded away a good young defensive center in Daniel Gafford for Daniel Theis, Troy Brown Jr, and Javonte Green. All of which are no longer with the team.

Mar 25 2021 - Traded WCJ, 2022 1st round pick (Franz Wagner, 8th overall), 2023 1st round pick (Jett Howard, 11th overall) for Nikola Vucevic.

Aug 2 2021 - Acquired Lonzo Ball, signed to 4 year deal

Aug 11 2021 - Acquired DeMar Derozan, once again sent away 2025 1st round pick, 2022 2nd round pick, 2025 2nd round pick

Aug 28 2021 - Traded Lauri Markkanen for DJJ and a Portland 1st round pick which will turn out to be a 2nd round pick because Portland wont make playoffs

June 23 2022 - Drafted Dalen Terry 18th overall. Never plays. BUST.

July 7 2022 - Signed Zach Lavine to 5 year 215M contract.

Nov 29 2022 - Extended Billy Donovan's contract.

2023 - Signed Jevon Carter and Torrey Craig. Sits on his hands and somehow thinks these additions while bringing back the same team will make us a championship contender.

Literally every trade AK has done he has lost. He threw away years of draft capital for a mediocre aging team. The players he has drafted are ASS (PWill, Dalen, Marko). I don't give him credit for Ayo because that was an obvious pick. He parted ways with young talent like Lauri, WCJ, Gafford. He signed AND EXTENDED a trash head coach in Billy. He gave a proven injury prone player in Lonzo a huge deal. He refuses to move on from this roster and admit his failures.

Does anyone have a differing opinion? I'm a big Bulls fan and I'm so upset with how AK has incredibly done worse than GarPax. At least GarPax had good homegrown talent and didn't mortgage away our future for old proven losers."

> League sources have mentioned Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand, Chicago Bulls general manager Marc Eversley and New Orleans Pelicans general manager Trajan Langdon as the three leading candidates for the top position with the Hornets.

> In addition to upgrading the roster and, most likely, hiring a new coach, the new exec will likely be tasked with overhauling and modernizing the team’s threadbare internal infrastructure, notably on the scouting and player health fronts.

The Hornets previously interviewed Eversley for their GM position back in 2018"
