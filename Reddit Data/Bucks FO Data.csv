1,Khris Middleton and his daughter at Fiserv Forum Tuesday for the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz rally,">”It was pretty cool,” Middleton told the Journal Sentinel. “I’ve met one sitting president before that in (Barack) Obama. I met Bill Clinton a couple times. So it was cool to finally meet Joe Biden. It was strange not being able to be there with the team for the White House but it was cool to kind of make a second time or second effort when he came to Milwaukee. I was definitely appreciative that I got the invite to come by and say hello. I got to bring my kids and my family so that was really cool, especially for them. One day they’ll look at that picture and realize how cool it was that they got to meet and take a picture with a sitting president.”

3,Jon Horst,"Seeing as how Jon Horst might be leaving the Bucks organization this offseason, we are going to see a lot of comments ""maybe for the best"" ""mixed history of success"" etc. First of all, name me a GM in any professional sport in any country that has made the historically correct, in hindsight, best move in every transaction ever?

""He hasn't drafted a rotation player"" - Jon Horst has drafted three times in the \*late\* first round since 2017. This isn't the NFL. Late firsts and seconds are hardly ever more than rotation guys, if that. All these young teams have been mostly drafting in the lottery for YEARS, and have had multiple picks. There have been studies done, that no GM is better at drafting than any other in any sport. The teams that draft best HAVE THE MOST PICKS, and high draft capital as well. For Wisconsin sports fans, that is why the Packers have been so good at drafting, they always have more draft picks then everyone else (Ted Thompson comp picks anyone?)

He traded FIVE seconds for Jae Crowder - honestly, not a good trade at all, but let's go back to some pre-Horst Bucks trades since we are going to assassinate Jon Horst's decision making over a couple second round picks that will amount to nothing:

Bucks throw in a first round pick to get rid of RAY ALLEN so they can get two months of Gary Payton and Desmond Mason

Bucks trade Sam Cassell for....Joe Smith and Anthony Peeler

Quinn Buckner for a player that had been retired for TWO YEARS. And SURPRISE played like an old retired guy. (For all the fans of the Bucks only since Giannis has been on the team - Buckner is still the Bucks all-time leader in steals and helped the Celtics win a championship two years later)

Trade Tobias Harris for two months of JJ Redick

A first round pick AND Norman Powell for 13 games of Grevious Vazquez

Glen Robinson for retirement home Toni Kukoc, Leon Smith, and a 1st rd pick (TJ Ford)

No one is obviously going to admit this from either team, but according to some reports, the Bucks had the option of Monte Ellis or Stephen Curry in the Andrew Bogut trade...the rest is history

Traded draft rights to Dirk Nowitzski so they could draft Robert Tractor Trailer

They traded Brandon Knight for Miles Plumlee, Tyler Ennis, and MCW when they could have kept the Suns first instead of MCW - that pick ended up being Mikal Bridges.

And tons of other small trades that literally made no sense, they were trading just for the sake of trading, especially in the 90s and early 2000s

  
In terms of drafting...John Hammond gets a lot of credit for drafting Giannis...Let's see how he did with LOTTERY picks:

2007: #6 pick Yi Jianlian

2008: #8 pick Joe Alexander

2016: #10 pick Thon Maker

   
In terms of free agents...This team let Alex English (yes that Alex English) walk for nothing because he wasn't getting enough play time. In terms of getting free agents...there isn't much of a recent history. Lets just say that Greg Monroe was the biggest FA pickup since Darvin Ham.

  
Now let's see John Horst's moves:

Right away takes a shot at improving the roster - trades Greg Monroe who's skills are no longer NBA relevant for Eric Bledsoe, a first and second round pick. Horst put some wonky protections on both picks. That kept the second round pick from conveying and the first round pick ended up being #30 overall. A lot of GMs around this time started adding similar protections to their first round picks in trades. Basically they got Bledsoe for nothing.

Picks up Brook Lopez for the BAE and Planet Pat for the minimum.

Ownership wanted to slash some salary - makes sense - there were a lot of bloated salaries from the 2016 offseason. Trades a first round pick and second round pick (again with protections) to dump Henson and Delly contracts, for George Hill who ends up being a huge culture piece and secondary ball handler for the Bucks, and Jason Smith. Also picks up two seconds from the Wizards for not keeping Sam Dekker in the trade (Ik there were some bummed out Badger fans). 

Trades four seconds for Mirotic - I don't care that it didn't work out, this was a good trade, and every single fan and TV personality was applauding Horst at the time. Mirotic left for Europe the next year and became a Euroleague MVP, he wasn't some bum. He was injured twice while with the Bucks and barely played during the regular season. We saw this season with Dame and Giannis that not having a lot of time to practice playing together and injuries has a hugely negative impact on performance. The Bucks took a player who was becoming a locker room issue in Thon Maker, and were going to swap him for Stanley Johnson. Horst doesn't complete the trade until the deadline, in the meantime the Pelicans are asking for a 1st round pick from everyone for Mirotic. The Bucks are able to reroute Stanley Johnson and Jason Smith to the Pels along with 4 seconds. The ""four seconds"" are enough to entice the Pelicans, even though one of the picks was a top-55 protected 2nd from the Nuggets (#57 - Jordan Bone). Two of the seconds were from the the previous Wizards/Dekker trade (Greg Brown and Elijiah Hughes), the last second the Bucks got back in the Jrue Holiday trade (#60 - Sam Merrill). If anyone here thinks the Bucks would have been better off with Jordan Bone and Elijiah Hughes instead of taking a legitimate shot at a title, please raise your hand. (I know Packer fans get pissed every time the Packers don't trade draft picks for a shot at a title)

One of the toughest offseasons in Bucks history to navigate, is able to resign Khris, Hill, and Brook (resigned Bledsoe during previous season). It is also difficult because they have to do an order of operations first, resign Brook/Hill with cap space because they had not been with the team long enough, resign Khris with bird rights, etc. Has to trade away RFA rights to Malcolm Brogdon because ownership would not pay for both Bledsoe and Brogdon. Bledsoe was the right move. It was a bad contract since because within the time of signing that deal, the NBA had shifted to unless you are as talented as Giannis, if you can't shoot threes, you are mostly useless, especially as a backcourt player. Brogdon had injury concerns and has really been injured a lot since, still is seen as a role player, and did not feel like he fit on the team. Additionally, Horst got a 1st (which was used in Jrue trade) and two seconds out of the Pacers, when the Pacers could have just signed Brogdon to an offer sheet because the Bucks were not going to match anyways. Also signs RoLo, and Wes Matthews and Kyle Korver on minimums (when was the last time the Bucks got that many names in an FA period?)

The Jrue trade offseason - self explanatory (also gets rid of Bledsoe and Hill contracts). Bogi deal falls through and Bucks get in trouble because nepo baby Alex Lasry on an owner conference call starts bragging about how good the Bucks starting lineup now is, hurt ego owners complain to Adam Silver and deal falls through. Donte's feeling are hurt, Horst is able to mend enough fences with Donte, gets his face on the side of Fiserv during the championship season and a starting lineup gig.

Signs Bobby Buckets, Torrey Craig, DJ Augustin, and Bryn Forbes - messes up PC contract, but it ends up being a good deal in the long run. In the past the Bucks just signed whoever in FA for no reason, guys like OJ mayo, Delly, etc. Here there is at least a reason for each pickup. Torrey Craig - tough defender who didn't get a lot of play time on Nuggets, minimum. Bucks needed a secondary ball handler since losing Hill (DJ), and 3-point shooting (Forbes, who was actually a starter for the Spurs for a minimum).

During the season, trades for PJ Tucker. Even if Tucker didn't help the Bucks win a championship, the trade accomplished multiple things:

- Got rid of the DJ Augustin contract

- Pushed the Bucks 1st round pick up a year (they got back their 2022 pick from the Cavs/Hill/Dekker trade) for their 2023 pick

- Pick swapped Bucks 2021 1st for Rockets 2nd (The Rockets were the worst team so they had the first pick in the 2nd round, which is more valuable than 30th pick since you have control over contract length)

- Got a large trade exception

Bucks win championship thanks to Giannis, Khris, and the core that Horst put together

2021 offseason - trades the 31st Rockets pick to the Pacers for four second round picks (I heard that four seconds is a lot, the 31st pick was Isiah Todd. Would I rather have Todd or Mirotic?) Packages two of those seconds with Sam Merrill for Grayson Allen, who was a good rotation piece. Trade is able to be completed due to the trade exception from the PJ Tucker trade (the gift that keeps on giving). Is able to get Grayson signed to a cheap extension early in the offseason. Resigns Bobby to under market value contract.

PJ walks in FA - based on reporting, it sounded like ownership didn't want to pay up. PJ was good with the Heat that one year, but has fallen off completely due to age after that.

Signs Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye to minimums, and George Hill to taxpayer MLE. These didn't turn out, but at least there was some thought behind the moves.

Rodney Hood was a great 3 and D player that everyone wanted up until the prior year, and Semi was one of the best Giannis defenders in the league the previous two years. Addition by subtraction. Bucks again needed a secondary ball handler/backup PG so they brought in a guy who already knew the team in Hill, slight overpay, but they did him dirty before getting him sent to OKC when they were a bad team. 

Trades Donte in four-team trade for Serge Ibaka and two seconds. Brook Lopez had been out most of the year with a back injury. Back injuries can be a fickle thing, so Horst took a risk to bring in an option if Brook was unable to play. Ibaka was washed by this time, but only a few years prior, was a really good player. Ibaka's defense on Giannis (along with Gasol) is the reason the Bucks didn't go to the finals that year. The Bucks had a lot of SGs in their rotation, and the Bucks were not going to pay both Grayson and Donte. Donte wanted a lot more money, Grayson signed a cheaper extension and was also starting at the 2. One of the seconds is the #33 pick this year, we will see how it turns out. Bucks also pick up Jevon Carter and Deandre Bembry off the scrap heap, Bembry unfortunately has a career-ending injury.

2022 offseason - Bucks resign literally everyone. Run it back with a good core, and locker room continuity. I don't remember the last time that has happened in the NBA. Bring in Jingles on the MLE, good locker room guy and was an amazing role player pre-injury, worth the risk. Draft Beauchamp - a developmental player with a high ceiling, hasn't seen the rotation much at all so far.

Trades for Jae Crowder - I think the ego of the Mirotic trade played a part here. The Bucks had no 1st and everyone knew the Bucks had wanted Jae for a long time, so Horst had zero leverage. Jae Crowder with the Heat and Suns would have been a perfect role player for the Bucks, unfortunately, Jae had been sitting out almost a full year, and just watching Dame this year, we can see how much missing time has an impact on performing at the highest level of basketball.

2023 offseason - there are jokes on this Reddit page every week about how Bucks fans should trade for Dame, but all we have to trade are Jrue, Grayson, and 2028 first. ""No way"" we can pull this off. Meanwhile, Horst uses his connections to keep his interest quiet. For over a month, he is able to keep the Blazers and Suns from leaking any info to literally any reporter. It was unbelievable. Look up the articles that were written about the behind the scenes. Once Dame was okay with expanding the teams in his trade request, the trade went through to the surprise of literally anyone. 

For those of you who think we should get a new voice in the front office, when was the last time a superstar of Dame's caliber came through the Bucks door? When the Lakers, Heat, Knicks, Warriors were trading for all the superstars in the early 2010s, whoever thought the Bucks could get in on that? Even though the players were no longer good, when else in their history would the Bucks have gotten big names like Pau Gasol and Goran Dragic in the buyout market?  Horst might have made some mistakes, but so does every GM. He at least approaches every transaction with some common sense, which has hurt the Bucks many times in the past with random signings and trades. Honestly, the 2024 season is the Bucks last best chance at a title with Giannis unless they get lucky. A full offseason prep for Dame. I trust Horst more to tinker with the roster than ""trade everything for Desean Watson"" Jimmy Haslem. The Bucks, for example, need to use their draft picks on upperclassmen for their rotation that can be good, cheap role players, guys like the Nuggets have done the last two years. Guys like Kevin McCullar Jr, Jalen Bridges, Hunter Sallis, Terrance Shannon, and Tyler Kolek. If Horst is gone, we are going to be trading Brook and both draft picks for some mid veteran who won't raise the bar. People may be mad over ""Jae Crowder for 5 seconds"" but it can be a lot, lot worse. Here's to hoping that Horst sticks around at least one more year.

Cheers Bucks fans

7,"[Eric Nehm] Bucks GM Jon Horst details team’s quiet offseason, Giannis at Olympics and Year 2 of Lillard","The Athletic's Eric Nehm interviews Jon Horst: [https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5658320/2024/07/26/bucks-jon-horst-qa-giannis-lillard/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5658320/2024/07/26/bucks-jon-horst-qa-giannis-lillard/)

It's behind a paywall, but there are are some interesting bits below. One matter of note, for those disposed to gratuitous trade-speculation, is that the Bucks ""have zero intentions of trading Brook"" and that they have ""not engaged in any real conversations about trading Brook"" and Horst ""hope\[s\] that Brook retires as a Milwaukee Buck"":

>**One of the rumors that was most connected to your team this summer was potentially trading Brook Lopez. When you talk about a move that could change the way that the team plays and also potentially bring you under the second apron, that feels like the type of trade you could be talking about. Is that something you considered and what are your thoughts on having Lopez on the roster moving forward?**

>First of all, rumors and chatter are what makes the league so interesting and so fun, so people are always going to speculate and talk about it. And I typically don’t talk about any of this stuff with the media, but I will say, because Brook is so core to who we are, we have zero intentions of trading Brook. Of course he has value around the league. That’s a credit to him. But we’ve not engaged in any real conversations about trading Brook. There are teams that have a lot of value and interest in him. It’s my job to take calls, receive calls, have conversations, but Brook has been and will continue to be core to who we are.

>I hope that Brook retires as a Milwaukee Buck. That’s been the goal since we originally got him. His impact on our team defensively and rebounding is elite. It only gets better. It’s not declining. I mean, he’s an anomaly in how he just continues to get better and better and better. For Doc, who got to spend time with Brook personally last year, Brook holds an incredible value for Doc for what he does defensively and rebounding and offensively, the spacing he gives us, and especially Giannis, is unique.

>People are going to always speculate and have conversations and they’ll think they know what they’re talking about, but at the end of the day, we have zero interest or intention of trading Brook Lopez. He’s a core part of our team. We’ve got a starting group now that we think is as good as anybody and we look forward to seeing how this team plays throughout the year.

...

I found it interesting that Horst included Pat among the players he was building a team *around* (""build a team that fits""):

>**While we try to tackle your offseason moves in chronological order, it makes a little more sense here to start at the end. Before the offseason got underway, there was discussion of Gary Trent Jr. receiving far more than the minimum this summer. How much did signing him mean to your offseason and what do you feel like he can bring to this team?**

>For us, having some of the [limitations with the CBA and the second apron](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5527008/2024/06/05/bucks-offseason-draft-roster-salary-cap/) — and we’ve always done this — but we’ve just worked really, really hard from the day that the offseason started until now as we continue to work to be super intentional and specific about who we add to this team, how we add to this team, and *trying to build a team that best fits Dame, Giannis, Khris (Middleton), Brook, Bobby (Portis), Pat (Connaughton)* and the group and Doc. So I feel very fortunate that we had an opportunity to have an offseason understanding what our core group of players was going to be, what our coaching staff was going to be, and then trying to build best fits. And I think Gary, in particular, epitomizes some of those targets.

...

There's no discussion of summer league performances, and Horst apparently still views Marion as among the young players that ""are ready to contribute now""; there aren't clear signs of Horst viewing Chris Livingston as having surpassed him:

>I think there’s a lot of upside to this roster, based on the acquisitions that we’ve made here in free agency, but I’ve always said that there’s a lot of upside to the roster, just based on familiarity with the coaching staff and roster. And don’t forget MarJon (Beauchamp), [Andre Jackson Jr.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/andre-jackson-jr-dt8Ot1gMrmMVt9Ff/), [AJ Green](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/aj-green-ogBspOJL4yP5FFV8/) and [Chris Livingston](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/chris-livingston-ZQ08nyTItom4qaka/) coming back and their improvements. I think those guys are going to have an impact on our team...

>...I love where we’re at. I love where we’re positioned going into the season. I love the balance of age and talent on our roster. We talked about it at the draft. We have six returning vets, three possible vet free agents, three returning young vets in MarJon, AJ and Andre that I think are ready to contribute now and three 19- or 20-year-olds in [AJ Johnson](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/aj-johnson-1V2BXVIJGy1RBFlj/), Chris Livingston and [Tyler Smith](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/nba/player/tyler-smith-uq0TmaSxGdDlfTvP/). Now we’ve filled that unknown in three vets with a 25-year-old Gary Trent, a 32-year-old Delon Wright and a 30-year-old Taurean Prince.

>...And I couldn’t be more excited about Delon and Taurean and Gary and the growth that MarJon and AJ, Andre and Chris are going to have in really adding to our defensive tool chest. I think these guys really are going to add to the things that we can do defensively as a group."

19,22-8 panic thread,"Well it**[‘](https://imgur.com/a/FcIUyuv)**s [that time of year again](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/s/8iPoyheGE0) which means it’s [that time of year](https://reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/zy3p27/the_bucks_are_2212_through_34_games_and_i_dont/) again, we’re ~~34~~ ~~35~~ 30 games into the season and New Year’s Eve is appropriately right around the corner.

You know what that means, it’s time to **FUCKING PANIC**!  That’s right North Korea has ballistic missile capability for their nukes, we’ve eclipsed ~~417~~ ~~419~~ 421 parts per million in daily average carbon dioxide concentration, and there are probably ~~79~~ ~~80~~ 81 million lizard people but it’s Bucks basketball that’s going to kill me.

First off, ~~Jason Kidd~~ ~~Mike Budenholzer~~ Adrian Griffin can’t coach his way out of a paper bag.  Or even a plastic one.  Maybe, maybe he could coach his way out of one of those cloth totes that environmentally conscious people carry with them to the store.  You know the ones worn by people who look like they expect a “congratulations” every time they’ve successfully completed their shopping and have made it back to the register.  Like carrying your own organic mayonnaise substitute out of the store in your own fancy fucking bag is worthy of a Purple Star.  That doesn’t make you better than me.  It’s like Bitch, I could have biked here– you don’t know.  Don’t look at me or my three plastic bags full of chips ahoy ever again.

Where was I?  Oh right, ~~Mike Budenholzer~~ Adrian Griffin is not good, let’s just put it that way.  I’m saying this as a four time consecutive champ in my 2k league, so I think I know what I’m talking about.  For instance, he’s been a coach in the league for ~~26~~ 15 full seasons and has only made the playoffs ~~24~~ 11 times.  And he hasn’t made the playoffs yet this year, so that basically makes him ~~24/27~~ 11/16 (AKA ~~~89%~~ 69%, a “nice,” but not-perfect grade in most academic institutions).  I mean how how long does it take him to figure out rotations? ~~35~~ 30 games? …~~36~~ 31 games? …~~37~~ 32 games? …~~38~~ 33 games? I could go on.  …~~39~~ 34 games? ~~40~~ 35 games? More?!  How many games even are there in a season?  No, really I don’t know.  Is it more than ~~40~~ 35?  I’m just a conceited Packers fan that doesn’t pay attention/watch NBA games until April.  But I have heard the terms “pick n roll” and “the triangle offense” before and if asked to use them in a sort of vague, indiscernible fashion within a sentence, I could probably do it.  So I know my opinions are valid.

Point being we’re straight, big time, totally and absolutely fucking doomed.  This team acts like they’ve never played a game of basketball together before.  It’s uncomfortable and often hard to watch.  It’s like watching a live feed of a youth group dance at a Boston middle school—you know like their parents told them they had to be there but they’d really rather be home playing video games or shitposting in r/politics so instead they just sort of waddle back and forth with no rhythm or anything.  I’m telling you, I’ve seen more chemistry in the back of my local RV park meth trailer.  And I don’t necessarily mean the cooking process, I just think Ricky and Sue Ann have a healthy relationship.  But to get back on track; you’d think that each and every individual on this team had been living somewhere else this offseason and, until they were contractually obliged to or covertly kidnapped and forced to live in Milwaukee via some sort of Oldboy or Saw scenario, hadn’t ever been teammates before.  When in reality that’s only the case for ~~8~~ 5 players out of the 15-man roster.

And how are we losing to teams like the ~~Rockets~~ and [*still*] the Bulls?  Neither team has played a single game of meaningful postseason basketball in years [*still*]!

Here are some facts we need to acknowledge if we don’t want to become a full-fledged disaster-event the scale of the Lusitania or ~~No Man’s Sky~~ [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/s/advpsg4hGJ):

**Trade:**

-~~George Hill~~ Cameron Payne for a conditional 2nd rounder in the G-League draft

-	We all know ~~Hill~~ Payne is human garbage and the single worst basketball player in the history of the world but has anyone checked to see if this isn’t just a metaphor?  Like maybe ~~“George Hill”~~ “Cameron Payne” isn’t an actual person but really a humanoid conglomeration of cardboard, trash bags and loose sticks that have drifted communally together from ~~New Orleans~~ [a monument to man’s arrogance](https://youtu.be/4PYt0SDnrBE?si=AbNcO_6orLi2B2Ym&t=11) and averaged ~~5~~ 6 and 2 [*again*] for us?  Worth looking in to.

-~~Joe Ingles~~ Jae Crowder for a 2nd round draft pick in the real draft

-	How did this middle-aged person end up on our team?  I thought he was in ~~Australia~~ [a city that shouldn’t exist](https://youtu.be/4PYt0SDnrBE?si=AbNcO_6orLi2B2Ym&t=11) or some shit.   We’re not seriously planning on giving him minutes are we? Are we?

-Khris Middleton for Gary Payton II straight up [*again*]

-	Everyone in /r/NBA says we made a mistake in trading Gary Payton away AND we waived Gary Payton II TWICE. And /r/NBA is infallible.

-~~Jrue Holiday~~ Damian Lillard for a 1st

-	Maybe there’s a team that needs a ~~scrappy defender~~ microwave scorer to fill their ~~dawg~~ chucking quota?

-Brook Lopez for a 1st [*again*]

-	The only player in the history of back surgery make a 200 percent recovery. Probably worth something.

-Giannis Antetokounmpo for Christian Wood and a 1st [*again*]

-	Remember the good ol’ days with Christian.  Yeah, he was the best.  Things clearly haven’t been the same since he left.  Literally everything was perfect before then.  I think…  Wait or was it [the Brandon Jennings era when everything was perfect](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/s/advpsg4hGJ)?

-Bobby Portis for two 2nd rounders and Dean Wade [*again*]

-	Bobby loves Cleveland.  I know.  I’ve heard him say it.  The bastard.  Let’s break up with him before he breaks up with us.  “Maybe in some other universe in some other time we could have worked out.  Bobby, I want you to know it’s me not you.  Okay?  I treasure our friendship and I wouldn’t want to lose that so let’s stay friends… I hear you can use some.”

-~~Jordan Nwora~~ Pat Connaughton for… Uh oh.  Oh shit.

-	Who the hell is going to take on this contract?  Who typed up this deal in the first place?  Are we high?

Edit: R.I.P. satire."
20,Horst is staying,
21,Big Ragu with 11 3s today! 🫡,"I am so happy hes doing well, loved him when he played for us just wish he could’ve been more healthy. That is all. "
22,"With 2:40 left in Q3, the Bucks led the Jazz by 16 points. They ended up losing by 15.","Some lights-out shooting by the Jazz let them pull close, plus an awkward landing on a Lillard throw down left him hobbled and off in Q4. Add a F1 on Crowder and some bad turnovers and this is an all-time Q4 collapse."
23,Our young core is actually very good ,"I was looking at all of the players under 25 and honestly, the Bucks future is in really good shape.

PG: AJ Johnson

The kid is an absolute dog in transition, has natural talent to pass the ball and get it to the open man, plays great defense, and can drive into the lane whether it’s right or left.

SG: AJ Green

Self explanatory. Excellent shooter. If AJ develops chemistry with him, that can be a scary backcourt.

G: Marjon Beauchamp

We’ve already seen his game develop nicely on both ends. He can score inside and move the ball around with ease. I’d like to see him work on his shooting technique some more, but AJ/Marjon could become a nightmare for defenders trying to guard the inside.

G/F: Andre Jackson Jr

This kid showed dedication to his development on both sides of the court. If he can continue working on his ability as a shot creator to go along with his skills as a slasher, he’s going to be a problem.

F: Chris Livingston

I’ve always been really high on him, and he has proven himself defensively as an anchor in the paint. He has shown promising ability as a pnr defender as well. Perfect fit next to Tyler Smith.

F/C: Tyler Smith

I think he might be the best player in this draft class. His offensive game is phenomenal, can stretch the floor, and is a great shot blocker. 

Those are 6 very good players that have length, speed, great ball movement, good defenders, great rebounding, shot blocking, and pick n roll defense that can create problems for our opponents. It seems a lot more optimistic than most Bucks fans think.

Thoughts?"
24,You absolute legend.,
25,Horst,"Horst is not perfect, but every move he's made, trades, signings, draft picks, all made tons of sense in the moment. The fact they didn't work perfectly does not make his mistakes terrible enough to warrant the boot.

Let's have some perspective.

Mirotic, the Pelicans were tanking, and we needed someone who could play a stretch big role, someone who could man the post and take threes because the backup PF spot was being manned by DJ Wilson and Ersan, neither of whom were ever going to cut it, then when Mirotic went back to Europe, Horst managed to get Bobby, and we know exactly what Bobby is all about, he's playing the Mirotic role but better. And Thon Maker was out of the league the year afterwards so it's not like any of the guys we gave up for Mirotic have been flourishing.

Brogdon did not like Milwaukee at all, and has proven to be consistently injured year after year, the hope with the Pacers pick was to flip it for better assets, which didn't work out, but oh well, it's not Horst's fault that someone wants a bigger role on a worse team for money the owners didn't want to pay him.

DJ Augustin was not a good signing, we needed a backup PG and the well was very dry, the on court product was bad and if there's something you can say about Jon, is that he's very good at weaseling the team out of bad roster decisions, him and DJ were banished to the tanking Rockets for PJ Tucker, the guy whose leadership made champions.

Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye were bad bad, but Horst still managed to get us out of their contracts by bringing in someone in a role we desperately needed, which me brings me to Ibaka.

Ibaka came at a really desperate time for our center position, we were bringing in washed up Boogie and Moose, Brook was missing lots of games with back surgery and there was worry that he was never going to be the same guy when he came back, Donte's value was in the gutter, multiple injuries, poor performance, impending contract woes, it made sense to flip him and the previously mentioned Semi and Hood in hopes of having someone competent, obviously didn't work out because of the miracle that was 2023 Brook, but even then, Horst managed to pull through.

Crowder is probably the second most controversial move made by Horst to date, but even that made sense, we were in dire need of a 3 and D wing, and Crowder was probably the best player we could get for our meager assets, the Crowder trade was Horst salvaging a bad move. Which did not work out perfectly, but that's expected.

Now for another point raised against Horst, draft picks.

There's a strange double whammy related to Horst that I can't wrap my head around. If Horst is so bad at drafting and developing, why shouldn't he use second rounders as fodder to trade for proven talent, but if that's the case then why are you complaining about how many picks he uses?

So Horst is bad because he trades away second round picks that we could use to get sleeper young guys but he's also bad because none of the players he's drafted have turned out great. A is not a good argument if B is the truth and vice versa. 

Who says Horst can't draft? From what I've seen, he's made decent picks and young signings according to our needs.

Nwora was a lights out wing scorer who was drafted in the hopes of being developed into a good defender, which didn't happen and he was ultimately turned into Crowder.

Sam Merrill was drafted as an additional ball handler and shooter, and who expects anything from a 60th overall pick anyway. Besides that, he's been doing very well as a spot up guy for a good Cavs team, and besides that, Grayson Allen was a good pickup.

Marjon hasn't shown the full extent of his development yet, but it seems like everyone in the org has something good to say about him, Doc included, so jury's not out on him just yet, this will be year three and lots of players hit their stride year three.

AJax has been universally praised as a good draft pick, enough so that he's been the subject of some really wild takes about how good he actually is as a rookie. Year two is on the horizon so who knows how much better he'll get.

AJ Green is the only young player in a good while whose seen substantial minutes, meaning Doc trusts him, and if Doc trusts a young player then that's a big point in Horst's favor as an evaluator of young talent."
26,What moves would you think about making as of now if you were the Bucks GM?,"We’re only five games into the season, but I already feel like the Bucks could benefit from one more trade. The 2-guard spot seems like a hole in the lineup since Beasley isn’t a great POA defender. The Bucks also don’t have an immediate solution on the roster yet: Pat seems to have gotten worse, Jae is more of a 3/4 nowadays, and Marjon has shown signs but is a little foul heavy. 

If you were Jon Horst, what would you look to do here? Here’s some broad options:

1. Don’t make a trade, keep seeing what you have with the current lineup and hope Marjon takes a jump to be a starting 2-guard

2. Trade for a premium role player like Marcus Smaet, while giving up Pat + Bobby Portis and potentially a few picks (definitely the 2024 first)

3. Look for a cheaper option from a team that has a logjam at guard or wing (Alex Caruso, DFS) and keep Bobby Portis and a few more picks


Those are a few options, but feel free to pitch any other ideas. If I were Horst, I’d go for option 2. The Grizzlies might be open to moving Smart after the deadline after the bad start. Marcus Smart gives you a great POA defender by Dame, and someone who has experience guarding Brown/Tatum. I personally think the team should be built to beat Boston, so moving Portis isn’t the worst idea since he turns into a liability against them."
27,Copium vs Hopium,"Jon Horst meet Keon Ellis

The proof is in the pudding. Our organization after Giannis has been tragic in developing young talent.

Ellis went UNDRAFTED in 2022 and was integral in limiting Steph Curry last night as a fork was stuck in the last shivers of the Warrior Dynasty.

The Bucks as an organization just use their G League team for guys that populate the end of our bench. Other organizations use their G League team for potential development.



And its not confined to the G League, we've mostly stuck with veterans to populate our core rotation and outside of Donte (who we gave up on anyway) we havent had an impactful draft pick or undrafted free agent with max potential since Malcom Brogdon.

 Thanks for bringing Jrue and the 21 championship but dont let the door hit you on your way to Detroit."
28,Milwaukee was very close to landing Bradley Beal but he didn’t like the trade Milwaukee would have to do to get him.,
29,Doc is coaching exactly like we should have expected,"Seems like a good time to directly confront the realities of Doc so anyone who's unfamiliar with his coaching has a better understanding going forward:

* Doc (mostly) doesn't play young players

Yeah, he's been giving AJ minutes but that's typical of Doc, he'll find one younger player that he gets fixated on while mostly ignoring the others. This plays into the next reality:

* Doc willfully ignores match-up disparities in lieu of playing vets

Last night's game was the perfect example of this - Memphis plays press defense with all their tall, young athletic guards and wings, which started tiring out the team early on the game...so what does Doc do? Simply keeps playing all the vets who couldn't match their height or athleticism. It was particularly telling when Doc tried out zone in the second half out of desperation...yet with the exact same old vets. Not saying AJJ and MarJon were going to be the perfect answer but lord knows we needed some fresh legs in the game to help close out on defense.

* Doc's absolute non-scheme on offense

Doc's offense is Bud's ""play random"" scheme but focused far more on individual match-ups and without any of the inside out game to fixed shooting spots so basically just a worse version in almost every way; I mean, just look at the offenses he ran in Philly and LAC, the definition of stagnant w/star-focused isos and basic pNrs without running any double screen actions or off ball motions. Doc's also *notorious* for over playing his older vets and *never* making in-game adjustments - this is why older players tend to like Doc but meanwhile, that's also how he alienates his younger players and causes locker room tension (just look up comments from Maxey & Thybulle about Doc, as 2 recent examples). And to top it off, Doc's got a rep for calling bad plays out of timeouts in big moments, which is something Bud excelled at and one of the few things AG did well too.

To be fair to Doc, I actually do think our defense has looked marginally better in his games and the team has had moments where they looked special again like in the Denver game...but fact is, we're going to keep selling (especially on the road) as this is an aging team of vets that can't always give you playing at 100% max for 30+ mpg in every game during the regular season. Imo, if we make a deep playoffs of run it will be in spite of Doc, not because of him.

Anyway, that's my rant and I just had to let it out...because while I've been trying to be positive about Doc, if I'm being completely honest with myself I've always really disliked his coaching so I'm gonna start acknowledging reality and stop it with all the denial hopium I started huffing after we hired him. Also, marked this as serious to try and keep the conversation focused on discussing Doc's coaching instead of just piling on low bar anti-Doc ""he sucks"" circle jerk comments."
30,Did John Hammond unintentionally cost the Bucks a chance at a dynasty?,"Now obviously it goes without saying that Hammond did bring in the Bucks two best players on the championship team - drafting one of the best NBA players in history outside the lottery in arguably the worst draft of the 21st century, and advocating to get Middleton thrown into the Jennings sign and trade was nothing short of a masterclass. However, if the below trades happened differently, we could be talking about a Warriors-level dynasty the last few years.

Trade deadline 2015 --> Milwaukee Bucks trade Brandon Knight and Kendall Marshall to the Phoenix Suns for Miles Plumlee and Tyler Ennis. Philadelphia sends Michael Carter-Williams to the Bucks and Phoenix sends a top-5 protected Lakers 1st round pick to the 76ers. That pick became unprotected in the 2018 draft and was the #10 overall pick where Mikal Bridges was selected. #11 was SGA and #14 Michael Porter Jr. in that same draft. The Bucks could have kept the 1st instead of sending it to the 76ers for MCW. 

2015 NBA draft --> Milwaukee Bucks trade the draft rights to Norman Powell and a lottery protected 1st round pick to the Raptors for 23 games of Greivis Vasquez. That pick became the #23 overall pick in the 2017 draft which was OG Anunoby.

I'm not including the Tobias Harris trade because it may have kept Hammond from drafting Giannis since Harris and Giannis both play the same position (or would have kept Middleton from developing if they moved Harris to the 3). 

Obviously, there is no certainty Jon Horst would have selected the right players with those picks, and I am not sure if switching Powell from the Raptors to the Bucks wins them the conference finals in 2019 (OG was injured). However, I think it is interesting that these two trades represent a microcosm of what the Bucks were before they became a championship contender - making moves that made them competitors but never fully trying to rebuild - and that kept them from being anything but mediocre for the longest time. "
31,FACTS,
32,Thank you Sam Merrill for your part in the Bucks acquiring Dame!,
33,What are your expectations for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023/2024 Season? [Start of Season Edition],"When I originally asked this question right after the draft the Bucks Fanbase had the fourth highest confidence in their team when compared to all other teams with an average score of 5.40.

To see all the results from the first poll and future ones for yourself feel free to check out this google sheet for yourself :[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EdV1\_5lSgeop\_yz5F55NO7LQIbXZRomIsPD8XvAH0QA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EdV1_5lSgeop_yz5F55NO7LQIbXZRomIsPD8XvAH0QA/edit?usp=sharing)  


After free agency I wanted to poll each fanbase again to see if their opinions have changed in association with the rest of the league.  


My plan is then to have another poll After the Trade Deadline to continue to see how the fanbases feel about their team and its overall progress!  


If you have any questions or suggestions for this project I hope you let me know and I'm looking forward to seeing a nice civil debate in the comments below ;)

Thank you guys for your participation and best of luck to your team and let's hope for a low injury season for all!
