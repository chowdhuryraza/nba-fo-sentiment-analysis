Most importantly he got enough guys around Cade to find out where he's at. I suspect we're still looking for a veteran center, am curious who he'll try to get."

26,"The ATHLETIC's JEIII shits on Weaver in his latest, or why I have little respect for many media members.","[https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5620165/2024/07/06/trajan-langdon-pistons-cade-cunningham/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5620165/2024/07/06/trajan-langdon-pistons-cade-cunningham/)

Edwards posted a new article that praises Langdon as a modern thinker who ""did not spend all his cap space the first days of free agency like management has done in the past.  He did not sign players to long contracts or overpay for said players like management has in the past.""

JEIII has long been considered an arrogant apologist for former DETROIT GM Troy Weaver, often pushing back on fan criticism with basic retorts that Weaver is playing 4-D chess while the fans only understand checkers. Yet  in today's article, he must have said ""past management"" 30 times in listing flawed ideas and tragic missteps that one can not help but hear Weaver in many of his examples.

And this is why I have very little respect for him as a journalist, I understand to be a beat writer you have to be professional and not bite the had that feeds you. But most players understand that to be a professional, you have to be honest with your readers. It was rarely that Weaver was ever criticized by Edwards. JEIII was the one that fed many fans that the PISTONS were one player or one season away from the play-offs, just give Weaver more time, more money, etc., despite repeated bottom of the league won-loss records.

A year or two ago, he started mentioning on twitter and in his articles, that the PISTON situation was not fair to Weaver because he was not given an all-star like James Harden or Kevin Durant that he could turn into multiple #1's. Of course if DETROIT had such players, they probably would not have an opening for Weaver in the first place. Which is rich because one of Weaver's first quotes went something like ""Every NBA draft contains good NBA players that are not always found at the top of the draft, it is my job to identify and get those players""

In fact, it was JEIII during the losing streak that started to openly question Williams (when he had previously rarely, if ever, questioned PISTON management, Weaver, or previous coach Casey) and blaming him for the losing streak. As if to say, ""like I have been telling you all, the roster is good, we are almost a play-off team and look what this guy is doing to it.""

So today, he posts this article. And it triggered me. How many times have we heard from beat writers that all is good when fans are questioning the teams management in direction (in all sports!) only for once there is a new management team in place or player is moved off of team, they mention all the warts fans were speculating about before. And the kicker is that they will phrase it such a way that these warts or mistakes are acceptable facts now, ""Everyone knew...."". No, everyone did not know.  You, Mr. writer, are our portal into the team and you call malarkey on those very facts you now say are obvious. How are we supposed to read you when anything you say today may be changed tomorrow.  You have an opinion, fine, then say in your article that your opinion is.... or ""others around the league may question this move because...."" But if I can not watch the game myself, than I rely on you, Mr. Writer.  I can not talk to the players or coach after game, so I rely on you to ask the questions that I want to know. Even if you are going to be a cheerleader for my team, that is ok, just be consistent.  The idea that Weaver could do no wrong, but everyone else in DETROIT's management team is shaky is untrue, and really a manipulative lie. When you have been historically bad as the PISTONS have been the last 4 years, no on gets to come off as above blame.

Shame on you, JEIII, for conveying anything different."
27,Seems like Michael Blackstone is officially the Vice President of Basketball Operations:,"Welcome to the team Michael, here’s to hoping you and Trajan can pull us out of this mess."
28,"Is it safe to assume the longer it takes to hire a POBO, the more likely it means they’re zeroing in on Connelly? ","Hypothetically speaking, let’s say the T-wolves make the finals and we still haven’t hired a POBO…it would lead me to believe Gores is about to throw the bag at Connelly? 

Or just more proof we’re incompetent. 

Here’s what Shams said about the [situation](https://www.si.com/nba/timberwolves/minnesota-timberwolves-rumors/could-tim-connelly-leave-the-timberwolves-01hxsrmk1e9q) 

> Charania reports that ""it seems likely"" that Connelly will remain with the Wolves, but, ""if Pistons owner Tom Gores is willing to offer something like $15 million annually, that could be enough to pry him away,"" he wrote."
29,Latest ESPN mock draft dropped . Pistons related intel instead ,"5. Detroit Pistons

Matas Buzelis, SF/PF, G League Ignite | Age: 19.6

Buzelis scheduled workouts with Atlanta and Washington, but for weeks now, rival teams have largely viewed Detroit as his likely landing spot. At this point, the Pistons haven't worked out other players who are ticketed for the high lottery, contributing to the idea that Detroit is the probable floor for him.

The Pistons are transitioning under new president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon's leadership, but their interest in Buzelis predated his hiring.

Currently other teams are viewing this as a likely marriage. Buzelis fits Detroit's timeline, positional needs and has the type of size and versatility at forward that Langdon's former group tended to favor (and had success with) during his five years as general manager in New Orleans. -- Woo



Clingan


Clingan is also viewed as a potential trade-up target for teams, including the Memphis Grizzlies, which could lead to him coming off the board ahead of this spot. However, the Rockets, Spurs, Pistons and Hornets don't appear to be landing spots for Clingan, so there are also scenarios in which he falls to No. 7.


Dalton Knecht

Knecht's draft range is appearing increasingly small, with teams in the Nos. 4-9 range all expressing significant interest, except Detroit at No. 5.

Salaun

Salaun is one of the tougher lottery prospects to peg in terms of a draft range, as he has had limited time to conduct workouts after recently arriving from Europe. Quite a few teams would like to get to know him better. Salaun, ranked No. 9 in ESPN's Top 100, conducted workouts with Portland, Sacramento and Oklahoma City before spraining his ankle this past weekend in San Antonio, which might prevent him from working out in scheduled visits with Detroit and Charlotte.



Reed Sheppard - mentions both Texas teams are interested (Dallas and Houston) also Charlotte at 6th . No mention of Detroit interest.Does it mean anything? Maybe,maybe not.

Cody Williams range starts at 5 and he’s drawn interest from almost all top 10 teams 

Jakobe Walter had a 1 on 0 Bismack Biyombo workout here.



This is smelling like a Buzelis promise 


Personally I’m fine with this …Knecht is an idiotic pick for a team that won 14 games and Clingan hasn’t shown enough imo to throw Duran away "
30,Cade grew,
31,This would be the funniest timeline,
32,Gores please give Tim Connelly a god father offer to bring his ass to Detroit,
33,"Press Conference Tomorrow, Weekly Friday News!",
34,Latest ESPN Mock- Pistons take Matas Buzelis,"Top 4 was Risacher, Sarr, Sheppard, Castle.

""Rival teams continue to view Buzelis and the Pistons as a likely pairing. He worked out for most of the teams in this range, including the Hawks, Wizards, Spurs and the Charlotte Hornets, but the Pistons haven't worked out many other prospects who are ticketed for the high lottery, other than Clingan and Cody Williams. Point guard Rob Dillingham recently visited but didn't conduct an on-court workout.

The Pistons fired coach Monty Williams last week, putting the onus on the front office, now led by Trajan Langdon, to identify the right fit without a coach in place. Detroit's known interest in Buzelis predated Langdon's hiring, and it remains to be seen what direction he'll take with the roster, but there has been little indication at this point to dissuade from the thought Buzelis will land here.

Buzelis fits Detroit's timeline and positional needs, and he has the size and versatility at forward that Langdon's former group tended to favor (and had success with) during his five years as general manager in New Orleans."" -- Woo
