,Title,Content
0,"Suns GM James Jones tells @BurnsAndGambo that there is no scenario in which Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal would be traded this offseason.",
1,Bud and James Jones locked in scouting the draft combine scrimmages.,
2,"[Bourguet] James Jones said the Suns wanted to get more athletic and add some size defensively, and they accomplished that with Ryan Dunn, while also adding some extra draft capital for the future",
3,James Jones: “we could benefit from having a point guard”,
4,Kellan Olson (@KellanOlson) on X James Jones says he believes no team has properly maximized Kevin Durant yet and they want to be the first team to do so. Called it a phenomenal offensive season for KD. Reiterated the Suns were not on the same page and ran out of time.,
5,"Asked James Jones about Grayson Allen and a potential extension. He first joked, “You’re asking me to project 5 months from now?” Then: “We don’t want him to go anywhere, which is why he’s here. There’s plenty of interest in Grayson Allen, but no one values him more than we do”",
6,"[Bourguet] James Jones on Ryan Dunn's shooting and his faith the Suns will be able to help him improve in their development program: ""He'll be primed to improve as a shooter, and if he can do that and do it quickly, he'll be a gem.""",
7,I see a lot of Vogel hate but James Jones has ignored big holes year in and year out,"Finals year we had no big depth and ended up getting killed by bigs  
  
Season before last we have no shot creators outside of Booker and we instead are forced to rely on Shamet and Payne  
  
Now we have 0 point guards and no wings behind KD on top of having shaky big depth.  
  
~~Really the only thing James Jones has contributed was drafting Cam Johnson, who he traded a 6th pick for an 11 and Saric, which feels like we got hosed tbh. No way Saric was worth 5 spots in a draft.~~ Edit: Apparently James Jones didn't make the CJ pick
  
We even lost a 2nd round pick tampering for Eubanks of all people.  
  
Also seems like he has trouble evaluating talent in general  
  
It's a little early for me to turn on Vogel but James Jones might be the worst GM in the league from what I've seen"
8,Fire James Jones,"The Suns just did a win-now move that made our starting lineup considerably worse. That’s fucking stupid.

We just traded a top 6-7 center and one of the highest potential post defenders to a bottom 5 starting center defender last year. 

We just traded our 2018 #1 overall pick for a 29 year old center with shot knees. We now have a center rotation of Nurkic, Eubanks, and Metu.

The Suns have simultaneously lowered our chances of winning a championship, shortened our championship contention window, and has absolutely skullfucked our franchise beyond 2028. 

Do not let James Jones do anymore damage to this team, don’t let him put us further into the dirt in the coming years. James Jones now deserves to have been fired yesterday, our franchise would’ve been better off for it."
9,What would you do if you are James Jones?,"Tough start of the season, we all know the team aren’t performing as expected. What are things you are looking to change if you are GM?"
10,James Jones,"Seems like every year, for like the last 3-4 seasons jones has had a very active trade deadline.

Love having a gm that is constantly grinding and taking chances.

Will his moves pay off? We will see

But I’m enjoying this era of suns ball"
11,Happy James Jones Day,
12,Is James Jones here next season?,Is JJ here next season if the Suns have a disappointing playoff run? (provided the Suns make the playoffs)
13,"[Rankin] Nurkic: ""I just try to do my role, whether I like it or not. We can talk about that, but I accept it. The owner (Mat Ishbia) and GM, James Jones, they explained it to me. It's appreciated what they're asking of me. It's been weird to be used the way I've been used.""",
14,James jones,He has done a awful job building this team we have no balance no really good defenders we have role player giving up open 3s and driving to the rim to turn it over shocking 13-12 this year is not good enough we have had the easiest run in the nba this year
15,"Bye Frank Vogel, bye James Jones, bye half the players on this roster!",What did we do to deserve this to happen four straight years?
16,My little contribution to warding off the bad juju James Jones is giving to the fanbase right now,

19,It’s nice seeing the Mavs lose,
20,"Remember when we let go/got rid of Torrey Craig, Jock Landale, and Cam Payne for no reason?","Torrey Craig shot 39% from 3 this year, better percentage than Eric Gordon! His defense and rebounding would've been pretty nice to have too.

Cam Payne was also solid from 3 and has at least decent passing and defensive ability, he would've been our best guard off the bench.

Jock Landale.... He really sucked at the beginning not going to lie but he got better. Plus he had great chemistry with KD and Booker. No way he could've possibly been worse than eubanks.

All this to say, I don't exactly trust James Jones on the margins. He has repeatedly shown he isn't good at filling out the roster and I'm concerned that he's still untouchable in the org."
21,😣,
22,Ayton requested a trade privately,"There it is, in his presser when referring to the trade, he let it slip that he thanked James Jones for accommodating his wishes.

The sentiment of ""we should have waited to see what he looked like in Vogels system"" dies today."
23,How good of an owner is Matt Ishbia exactly?,"He came in swinging his big dick and thought he could brute force his way to a championship on day 1.  

He traded away all our talented , great culture guys in exchange for a fading star, and set us back a decade.

This dude might be rich but he has shit for brains.  Let James Jones do his job:"
24,Who are some prove it players the Suns might try to target?,There are a couple teams that have a large enough cap space to take a lot of these names off the list. My personal opinion is targeting a Nerlens Noel but honestly I have no clue where dude has been
25,Enough with these casual hindsight takes 🤦‍♂️,"Everyone who's saying we shouldn't have made the Durant trade are the same people who rooted for it nonstop. People saying we tore a championship team down for Durant completely forget we just lost a 2-0 lead to the mavs the year before and we're hanging around .500 before trading for Durant. Everyone acts as if we went to the finals and made the Durant trade a week later lmao. It didn't work, so what? We traded our first round picks which will all be in the 20s and do you know what that equates to? NOTHING. Please go look at who the nets took last year with our pick, he played 2 games because he couldn't get on the court. Look at every draft from the last decade and tell me how many names you even recognize after 20. Cam and Allen are a wash. So essentially we lost Bridges (who is 28) for Durant. 

Would everyone be more happy if we stayed where we were and lost in the second round w cam and mikal year after year, or risked it all on a top 10 player in the history of basketball??? I swear, all these people with their dumbass takes started watching the suns in 2021 and have no idea what it takes to win a chip. We went for it and lost, but im happy we actually put our all chips in the middle and went all out because that's how championships are won 95% of the time. 

And holy shit, if I hear one more time that IT is the puppet master behind this team i'm going to lose it. As if IT is controlling Ishbia and by proxy forcing James Jones to make moves....when Jones had been working on the Durant deal before Sarver was ever forced to sell the team. Every IT rumor has been debunked, they are close friends and he sucks, but stop trying to find a scapegoat. 

STOP WITH THESE RIDICULOUS TAKES! If I hear one more post 2020 suns fan, who never cared about the suns or payed attention before we got good, I will lose my mind. BE PATIENT. These posts about trading beal durant and booker and unbelievable. Hell ya, I can't wait to go back to drafting Alex Lens and Josh Jackson's in perpetuity. Another full year with this team meshed together could do wonders and it's really our only option. Even the most delusional fanbase (Lakers) weren't trying to trade AD and Lebron after their string of postseason failures because there is no getting better than that, same with Durant and Booker.  

"
26,"[Woj] Free agent G TyTy Washington Jr., has agreed on a two-way contract with the Phoenix Suns, Kevin Bradbury of @LiftSportsMNGMT tells ESPN. ",
27,Does Lebron have a better shot at a title with the Suns or Lakers next season?,"With the news Bronny will work out for the Suns, the chance Lebron walks to Phoenix on a vet min has risen to something above absolutely zero. Obviously slim chance lebron walks away from a $120m extension and is probably using the Bronny workout in Phoenix to leverage LA into both the extension and drafting his son. But he said he wants to play with Kd and his relationship with James Jones is….something.

If instead of money, Lebrons main goal with his son is to win a title, does he have a better chance on the Suns or Lakers next season?"
28,Gambo: Rules out Dayton F/C DaRon Holmes II for the Suns at No. 22. Marquette PG Tyler Kolek is a player the Suns are interested in at No. 22.,
29,How did the suns go from having arguably the best future in the nba in 2020-2021 to now having one of the worst?,"Even though the Suns were not a championship team in 2020-2021, they still had an amazing young core with Booker, Mikal, Cam, and Ayton with all of their draft picks. Now their core is still Booker but also KD and Beal who aren’t playing as well as they did during their best years and probably arent going to get better over time. The suns are also completely drained of draft picks and any sort of young assets with their rest of their players on rental contracts. While I still think there is chance they turn things around and compete for a title, their window seems to be very short. I guess the 2021 nets and lakers wasn’t indicative of how you shouldn’t build a team to James Jones.

The worst fact of the matter is that Beal has a $56 million player option in 2026-2027. Gross"
30,"The best off season in suns history, turned to shit right at the end","No words, I'm actually upset at this"
31,Trading for KD wasn’t the mistake,"Suns had to give up 3 first round picks, Mikal and Cam. But thats the price necessary to get a MVP level player.

Lets be real. A core of Book, Mikal and Cam isn’t a championship core. It took those 3 and MVP level CP3 and a motivated Ayton to make the Finals. Those 2 are not in existence in 2024. At best the core of Book, Mikal and Cam are a 2nd round team. 

Having a KD/Book top 2 is a recipe for a championship contender. Getting KD wasn’t a mistake. The mistakes is what they built around the Big 2.

Suns desperately needed a PG and a defensive center if they were to trade CP3 and Ayton. Instead they got a more offensive minded center, two shooting guards and a wing. Seriously.

This team is totally different with a true PG and a solid defensive center.

Instead the Suns went all in on offense and scoring. Fine. Then at least hire a coach who can run a great offense. Nope. 

The mistake wasn’t trading for KD. The Suns needed another elite scorer to be a contender. The mistake is how they built around the 2 superstars. Instead of trading for pieces that fit, they went all in on scorers"
32,So many BAD moves after the KD trade,"KD move was good IMO. He is still a top 15 player and Book needed a legit scorer with him. 

The problem were the moves after that. 

Traded Dario for nothing. Would have been great to have Dario as a stretch back up center instead of Eubanks.

Getting rid of Cam Payne for nothing. Would have been great to have a backup point guard. 

Trading for Nurk. Big mistake. As bad as Ayton was at least he was decent at guarding pick and roll and could actually finish at the rim. Nurk is bad at both. There must have been a better trade out there. Nurk simply isn’t a playoff center when teams will pick on him the entire game. 

Trading for Beal. Dumb move. If nothing better was available then just keep CP3. Beal’s contract is a total nightmare and trading 1st round swaps is brutal 

Not signing a single point guard. Come on

34,Suns release halftime message ,
35,Jordan Goodwin,That is all.
36,DEVELOP. YOUR. YOUNG. TALENT,"Get that through James Jones' thick fucking skull. championship rosters aren't built from getting good players from several different teams and putting them together Frankenstein style 

Look at Boston, Denver, okc, even wolves. They underwent several years of mediocrity while developing talent they either drafted naturally or got pretty close to their rookie years and nurtured them over several years of playing under the same system. 

The path forward is getting YOUNG talent. Trade KD to a win now team, get some first round picks back and let them develop with booker and Beal. Yes, this means we'll be bottom feeders for the next 2-3 years but booker will still be at his peak after that. That's the only way to salvage our future. 



"
37,Ishbia needs to decide if the coach or roster should be changed,
38,Is it time to quietly start shopping Booker?,"I already know I’m going to get a lot of hate for this post and I’ll get called a lot of names but hear me out here: this playoff performance confirmed our worst fears, that the Suns are drifting further and further away from a title. Beal can’t be moved because of his no-trade clause and because no other person besides Matt Ishbia would ever pay 50M a year to a guy who can’t stay healthy and because Beal put up big numbers for a team that was consistently awful. KD still has trade value, but not enough to fundamentally change your roster. Booker is still in his prime. He could fetch some great players and picks in a trade. It’s obvious right now that he’s not enjoying himself. I have no doubt that he’s going to force his way out of town so that he can be the 2nd or 3rd scoring option somewhere else and he can take some of this media pressure off of himself as well. He can talk all this shit about “be legendary” and everything else but he is not Kobe! He is not built to be an alpha dog, it’s not in his personality. The Suns have zero cap space and zero draft picks. If James Jones keeps trotting out the same “Big 3” for the next 3 or 4 years he’s going to have a fan mutiny on his hands. He needs to quietly start making phone calls and putting together a trade before Booker forces his way out and the Suns get pennies on the dollar for him. Seriously though, do any of you have any interest in watching this core of Booker, Durant and Beal run it back next year? I definitely don’t at all. "
39,How to fix the Suns,"I've been thinking a lot about how to fix our team and I've developed this plan that I know will work.

**1. Get a new coach**
We need a new coach that can get along with the players, Frank Vogel obviously lost the dressing room. I propose we go after Monty Williams, he has history with Devin Booker and coached him to the final. Additionally, after a lot of down years, he will be cheap to get. He's not the most tactical coach, so perhaps we bring in an offensive guru on the bench, I heard Kevin Young from BYU is meant to be the real deal.

**2. Get a real Point Guard**
We need someone who can run our offense, no more Booker/KD isolations. We need the Point God, the hall of fame point guard, Chris Paul. This guy is an offense mastermind, yes, he's a bit old, but that means he's experienced. I know he breaks down in the later rounds of the playoffs, but I'll happy to even get to the later rounds. He's also on a huge expiring contract, we should trade Beal for him and get rid of his contract. 

**3. Trade KD for some younger players**
Kevin Durant is too old, we need some young blood in the team. I propose we trade him for some young wings, the Brooklyn Nets want to contend, I think trading KD for Bridges/Cam Johnson + picks makes sense for both teams. 

**4. Get rid of Nurkic**
Nurkic is a great regular season player but is always injured and doesn't hold up in the playoffs. I propose we trade him for a younger center who will match up well with Jokic. A player I've liked is Deandre Ayton, a young do-it-all center from Portland. He's rumored to have attitude and motor problems, but I think the ""dog"" in Booker will be a good influence on him. 

**5. Get some good role players**
Obviously we're over the cap, so getting good role players is hard. We can swap Grayson Allen for Landry Shamet, who can do everything Allen can do for less. Some good free agents min guys include J Crowder, Cam Payne and Frank the Tank.

I think this all makes sense, I hope to see it soon."
40,"The Phoenix Suns are closing in on hiring Brooklyn Nets executive Matt Tellem in franchise’s front office, sources tell ESPN.",
41,So we cheering for the Pacers on Saturday?,"Still mad about that robbery but started getting over it now because there’s nothing we can but we can talk about how James Jones and the suns passed on drafting Haliburton, smh how do we fumble that? Bro is paying so great in Indiana imagine if he had him as our PG. Man this team would had been so elite."
42,Suns had turnover problems last season?,"Suns had turnover problems?

They just signed the two best assist to turnover ratio players in the league.

Tyus Jones had 7.3 AST to 1 TO last season.

Monte Morris was 9.9 AST to 1 TO.

Suns got their point guard(s).

Take a bow, James Jones."
43,Actual plan to fix the suns,"Suns have a leadership void, since CP left.

Suns have a backup PG void.

Suns have a dubious Head Coach.

**Solve all 3 problems by hiring CP3 as player-coach. **

CP coaches the team, and then subs himself in for backup PG and the close out games with middies.

Gets his suit back on for post-game presser. 

CP doesn't play when Scott Foster refs.

We sign Bronny and Bron for depth.

Play 5-out banana boat style to close games with Bron/KD in the front court, and Book, Beal, CP in the backcourt. 

Bron is head assistant in this scenario.

Someone make sure Ishbia is taking notes.

James Jones can round out the bench."
44,With the Announcement of the new G-League team and the fact that they will be playing right in Tempe its Just another piece that falls into place for Bronny getting drafted and Bringing Lebron in to follow,"From a money standpoint Bronny Will have the G-league games packed and because of the location Bronny will still be with the main team all the time and with his dad all the team. On the other side Lebron can watch Bronny play because the G-league games are just 20 minutes away.

This is already our team is Built perfectly if you just put everything around lebron running Point forward. James Jones connections, KD connections, Book and KD recruiting at the Olympics. Close proximity to LA, Hating on Dan Gilbert with Ishbia CP3 potentially following after the warriors cut him. it all fits."

Made this thread 3 1/2 months ago and there were still some Eubanks supporters (lol)

&#x200B;

Eubanks has a +/- of -108 on the season. The only Suns rotation player in the minus let alone in 100s our other guys who were minuses we traded in the Royce trade. Vogel and Eubanks love affair has cost us literally many games this season. I think someone from the FO told him he is fired if Eubanks sees minutes. This dumb fuck hopefully finally has him out of the rotation.

&#x200B;

Also he started Royce over Grayson which for playoff ball is the way to go. "

49,2005-2006 Phoenix Suns,"This was such a fun team. Coming off of a year where they surprised the league going 62-20 & made the conference finals everyone thought this team was in for big things... then they lost Joe Johnson & Quentin Richardson to the Hawks & Knicks. They then lost Amare Stoudemire for the entire season due to knee surgery. It was looking bad. But this team (largely due to Nash's abilities to elevate teammates) saw breakout seasons from newly acquired Raja Bell & Boris Diaw & young gaurd Leandro Barbosa. Newly acquired players like Kurt Thomas, Eddie House, & James Jones gave them solid bench minutes. And this team was surprising everyone again. Nash was his 2nd consecutive MVP. They picked up Tim Thomas late in the season who was huge for them in a few playoff games. They finished 54-28 & once again made a trip to the western conference finals. This team was fun as heck & Nash definitely deserved a 2nd straight MVP after being able to mesh this team together & make another deep playoff run. "

This team has 5 hall of famers still able to perform (6 total).  Will always have bron or cp3 on the court. 5% chance best case, but not 0.00001% imo. obv the most unlikely is lebron, but if it happens all bets are off - cp3 and klove are sort of obvious then - bron has to know this and know that he could get cp3 there as a package deal and get to play with an all-star cast close to home.  

also will leave this here as lebron keeps going out of his way to call james jones 'MY guy' - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNiNRri09_w"
54,No one should be safe ,"Hey everyone,

First post here but have been on the sub for a few seasons now. I’ve been a Suns fan all my life, and I’m not sure I’ve ever felt this down. The Beal contract cannot be restructured, and he has a no trade clause (don’t think any team is trading for him anyway). We all know the cap situation this has created. So with Brad staying, that means we have four options: 

1. Run the same “Big 3” back, clear out the bench, and basically hope to find some bench players that are competent (huge if because of cap space issue). Maybe miraculously find some PG who could play 20+ minutes that can elevate the team (don’t see how this happens considering cap space issue). 

2. Trade Book- Most valuable asset we have. Would get a good NBA player, maybe a role player, and probably a few first rounders. Miami kinda comes to mind since Butler is there leader and book doesn’t have to take that role since he’s incapable of doing it here. I’m a huge booker fan, absolutely hooper, hence why he has the most trade value. Reason for trading him besides that is it’s clearly not worked here, and Book hasn’t exactly been a leader in the locker room and I think the criticism that he’s soft is unfortunately warranted. 

3. Trade Durant- Once again, love him, absolute assassin. Still has good trade value. Can put a team like OKC over the edge. Could get a few nice players and maybe a draft pick or two. He is still playing at an elite level, so his trade value shouldn’t be much lower than what we gave for him. This way you keep the hometown star in Book, can maybe get a few good players around him, but you still don’t win a title with that team. 

4. Trade both- drastic, and admits complete failure which I’m not sure Ishbia is ready to do despite this disaster. Would get all the draft picks we lost back basically, a few decent to good players, trade them, and once again Beal is on a team tanking for picks. This sounds horrific, but after big bad Steve Cohen did a similar thing that Ishbia did and utterly failed, the Mets swallowed the bullet and did this with Scherzer (Bealish), DeGrom (Durant-ish), Verlander (book), and got significant prospects in return. I get it’s a different, but maybe the same logic could be used. Should Ishbia just bite the bullet, and blow up the ship? 

Finally- Vogel being fired is a given, but James Jones should also be given a pink slip. It won’t happen because Ishbia loves him too much, but he has been HORRIFIC the past few years, in critical years. Will never forgive not drafting Haliburton (I think he was in draft before 21’, and if so would’ve won in 21 if we had him). Not to mention, the Beal contract is so horrendous, it’s worth being fired over. 

Sorry everyone, this is a horrible time, and I hope we can all look back on this one day and laugh. Go Suns "
55,Royce O'Neale has fit the Phoenix Suns like a 🧤| Offense + Defense Highlights |,
56,We need more size,"James Jones made this mistake during our finals run. Saric went down and we had no big man depth, so we were forced to play Frank Kaminsky vs Giannis when DA kept getting into foul trouble.  
  
Now it's 2023 and we have an unathletic 6'9"" center behind Nurk, who's a foul machine. And to top it off we're running him out there with a 3 guard lineup. Lakers had 21 offensive boards today while our dudes looked like baby chicks reaching for a meal.  
  
We lost the finals due to lack of big man depth once. I swear to God, this can't happen again  
  
Edit: my point is we need another big for depth"
57,Kevin Durant and Devin Booker play basketball today,predict statline for our duo!
58,Help me understand how we got better from trading Ayton. Where are we better?,"Ishbia should definitely get his first ring, but only if Milwaukee decides to give him one. Why help out your opponent if you are not going to make your own team better?

They gave up 18 and 10 for a guy that is slow and might play 55 games. How does this trade actually make the team better? Where are they better as a team? What positions benefited from this enough to cover the giant difference between Ayton and Nurkic? If the trade had been for a great defensive center, that is not a walking injury waiting to happen, then I could see the benefit, but that is not what they traded for. If the trade had brought in a really solid starter at the 3 or 4, then I could see the value.  But the Suns did not get better in this trade, they got worse AND made the team that they may face in a final better. 

James Jones and Ishbia certainly made Milwaukee better, but PHX is worse off.

They had 4 very solid starters, now there is 3, an injury prone slow footed center and who? All of the potential ""5th"" starters are marginal starters at best.  

Plus they picked up another shooting guard, because I guess there are not enough of them on the team? He is also a dirty player that has a skill set that 3+ other players already have.  They did not get better at any position through this trade.  Is Allen any better than Okogie, Gordon, Goodwin, Diop, or Yuta?  Is it enough to take the huge downgrade going from Ayton to Nurkic to make your 8th or 9th player maybe a bit better?

https://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/position/c

11 Ayton
32 Nurkic

I certainly hope this works out.  But I do not see how this makes us better overall as a team."
59,"Mat Ishbia said he’s not going to get into the status of Frank Vogel.   “I have not had one discussion about my GM, my coach or trading players, now supposedly in the media. Not one discussion is being had.”",
60,Donavan Clingan,What are the chances Clingan is available in the draft?
61,Should have kept this man,"We should have kept Cam Payne. As much of a liability he could be at times, he would have been so great on this team. The Suns offense would be so good if we can just play fast break basketball but we can’t go over 3 straight games without having 20 TO.

Cam’s name is literally turbo, just let him gun it to half court and attack the D before they could get set. The last time he played with a smart big (Saric) he was being mentioned for a 6th man of the year award. He was a reason we were still competitive with Denver last year and would have given us another player that could put pressure on the rim besides for the Big 3. Instead we traded him for a roster spot for Bol Bol (who’s been amazing btw) and don’t even play him in the playoffs. James Jones really fumbled on this one.

"
62,Suns pick ,The suns workouts so far have all been second round picks my guess it we move the 2 first rounds we have to get some good players and get a second round and try and take bronny?
63,2024 Draft option - Oso Igahdoro ,"Now that the Lakers have their 2024 draft pick, we can move on from the Bronny drama and look at some other draft options. This sub hasn't been the cheeriest of late but with the draft coming up, it should be fun. Chances are your favourite Suns player was probably drafted by Phoenix. At # 22 for you consideration I give you Oso Ighadoro. The Senior Center out of Marquette. Ighadoro has two elite skills - passing and perimeter defence. When Nurk can't stay on the floor, Oghadoro can. It's on the offensive end however, where Ighadoro can make the biggest difference to our team. James Jones talked about the challenge of getting the best out of KD and what is the best basketball situation for him. Well KD in my opinion played his best basketball in Golden State with Draymond Green alongside him.  Draymond Green's biggest strength - perimeter defence and passing. So whyy wouldnt we prioritise a passing big who can anchor our defence?  Kevin O'Connor from ringer gives him a comp to Al Horford and ESPN has him in a sleeper tier. Most conclude he has the skills to stick in the NBA. Sort of a nice pick up for us, right?  In the half court we could give the ball to Igahdoro in the paint and surround him with Beal, Allen , Booker and KD. Ighadoro could be a pseduo point for us with elite scorers cutting and moving into open spots for Igahdoro to find them. Hell I went down a rabbit hole recently with Bill Walton (RIP) and his time with the Celtics. Walton and Bird were an incredible pair. Walton would just find Bird in these spots where it was automatic. To the point it felt a like little cheating.  Now Igahdoro isn't close to Bill Walton but he's a modern big who has great vision. Watch that video and imagine KD and Book on the receiving end. Honestly watching the 86 Celtics was like poetry and by taking Oso Igahdoro we have a chance to emulate one of the greatest offensive in NBA history. "
64,Excerpts from the latest post by The Athletic on the Suns being swept and what happens next:,"> Sources briefed on the situation told The Athletic that Phoenix will take a hard look at making a full coaching change or, at the very least, discuss adjustments to Vogel's staff.  General manager James Jones, however, is expected to continue overseeing team-building for the Suns, those sources said

&#x200B;

> For his part, Vogel said before Game 4 that he is confident he will return next season, adding that he has the 'full support' of team owner Mat Ishbia

&#x200B;

>Across the season, (Kevin) Young was in charge of the Suns' game plans on the offensive end, which featured a heavy dose of pick-and-rolls for Booker and Beal. But Phoenix's players questioned the coaching staff's inability to structure the offense and maximize the output of a lineup featuring three of the game's best scorers, per team sources.

&#x200B;

>Sources briefed on the matter told The Athletic that Durant never felt comfortable with his role in Phoenix's offense alongside Booker and Beal this season... Durant had persistent issues with the offense, feeling that he was being relegated to the corner far too often and not having the proper designs to play his strengths as the offense was built around pick-and-rolls.

&#x200B;

>After head-scratching losses, it was easy to wonder if the Suns had enough leadership inside the locker room to help them navigate adversity. Durant said this week that while every Phoenix player had a voice - the freedom to bounce ideas and be heard - ""the coach is the leader.""

&#x200B;

>The Suns now enter the summer planning to build around their top six players in Booker, Durant, Beal, Allen Nurkic and Royce O'Neale... Phoenix officials hope to retain O'Neale as a free agent this season.  
>

He is a massive player as 7'4+ 300+ lbs.

He played with the Canadian National team in FIBA

Seems like the perfect guy to let Vogel Mold into the exact NBA center frank is known to coach.

Mock drafts seem to be split right now if he will go before or after our pick. But we could always try to trade up by swapping our future picks again.

I can just Imagin KD Bol Bol and Edey on the floor together. so much length."

Do y’all think the suns have something else up there sleeves other then waiving possibly Johnson or wainright?"
71,One reason we SUCK in the 4th,"We suck in the 4th for various reasons.

A couple reasons that have been brought up before: slow pace, too many turnovers, too many injuries and refs.

Here is another reason: On average KD and Book only share the court for 3 minutes in the 4th.

Usually Book plays the entire 3rd so he rests the first 6 minutes of the 4th. Then Book comes in and KD and Book stay on the court together for about 1.5 minutes. Then KD rests for about 3 minutes. Then KD comes back for the last 1-2 minutes. 

So Book and KD share the court for only 3 minutes in the 4th. That means if Beal is struggling or Gordan/Allen not shooting well it will be a problem. 

Some games KD doesn’t rest in the 4th. But then you risk KD tiring out. 

Is there a solution? Maybe change the rotations a bit? Could Book have a 3 minute rest in the 3rd? That way he can come back in the fourth earlier. That could allow KD and Book to share the court for 6 minutes in the 4th instead of 3.

Suns want KD or Book on the court at all times.

They will average 36 minutes a game.

That means they will share the court for only 24 minutes a game. Right now its:

1st Qtr - KD/Book share court for 9 minutes 

2nd Qtr - KD/Book share court for 3 minutes 

3rd Qtr - KD/Book share court for 9 minutes 

4th Qtr - KD/Book share court for 3 minutes 

Can there be a shift to have more 4th quarter minutes?

Or can they risk having KD and Book resting at the same time for a few minutes in the 2nd and 3rd quarter?"
72,Less than 50 games left - Whats the best winning rotation?,"I think Nas should start over Grayson. The guy is 6’ 6” and can be a nuisance on defense. Plus the bench could use a scoring boost. In the playoffs the suns will likely have to contend with Luka, Kawhi, or Lebron. Unless James Jones pulls a rabbit out his ass at the trade deadline, and manages to land a coveted 3-and-D guy, Little is our best point of attack defender."

Now we have 0 point guards and no wings behind KD on top of having shaky big depth.  
  
~~Really the only thing James Jones has contributed was drafting Cam Johnson, who he traded a 6th pick for an 11 and Saric, which feels like we got hosed tbh. No way Saric was worth 5 spots in a draft.~~ Edit: Apparently James Jones didn't make the CJ pick
  
We even lost a 2nd round pick tampering for Eubanks of all people.  
  
Also seems like he has trouble evaluating talent in general  
  
It's a little early for me to turn on Vogel but James Jones might be the worst GM in the league from what I've seen"
85,Fire James Jones,"The Suns just did a win-now move that made our starting lineup considerably worse. That’s fucking stupid.

We just traded a top 6-7 center and one of the highest potential post defenders to a bottom 5 starting center defender last year. 

We just traded our 2018 #1 overall pick for a 29 year old center with shot knees. We now have a center rotation of Nurkic, Eubanks, and Metu.

The Suns have simultaneously lowered our chances of winning a championship, shortened our championship contention window, and has absolutely skullfucked our franchise beyond 2028. 

Do not let James Jones do anymore damage to this team, don’t let him put us further into the dirt in the coming years. James Jones now deserves to have been fired yesterday, our franchise would’ve been better off for it."
86,What would you do if you are James Jones?,"Tough start of the season, we all know the team aren’t performing as expected. What are things you are looking to change if you are GM?"
87,James Jones,"Seems like every year, for like the last 3-4 seasons jones has had a very active trade deadline.

Love having a gm that is constantly grinding and taking chances.

Will his moves pay off? We will see

But I’m enjoying this era of suns ball"
88,Happy James Jones Day,
89,Is James Jones here next season?,Is JJ here next season if the Suns have a disappointing playoff run? (provided the Suns make the playoffs)
90,"[Rankin] Nurkic: ""I just try to do my role, whether I like it or not. We can talk about that, but I accept it. The owner (Mat Ishbia) and GM, James Jones, they explained it to me. It's appreciated what they're asking of me. It's been weird to be used the way I've been used.""",
91,James jones,He has done a awful job building this team we have no balance no really good defenders we have role player giving up open 3s and driving to the rim to turn it over shocking 13-12 this year is not good enough we have had the easiest run in the nba this year
92,"Bye Frank Vogel, bye James Jones, bye half the players on this roster!",What did we do to deserve this to happen four straight years?
93,My little contribution to warding off the bad juju James Jones is giving to the fanbase right now,

96,It’s nice seeing the Mavs lose,
97,"Remember when we let go/got rid of Torrey Craig, Jock Landale, and Cam Payne for no reason?","Torrey Craig shot 39% from 3 this year, better percentage than Eric Gordon! His defense and rebounding would've been pretty nice to have too.

Cam Payne was also solid from 3 and has at least decent passing and defensive ability, he would've been our best guard off the bench.

Jock Landale.... He really sucked at the beginning not going to lie but he got better. Plus he had great chemistry with KD and Booker. No way he could've possibly been worse than eubanks.

All this to say, I don't exactly trust James Jones on the margins. He has repeatedly shown he isn't good at filling out the roster and I'm concerned that he's still untouchable in the org."
98,😣,
99,Ayton requested a trade privately,"There it is, in his presser when referring to the trade, he let it slip that he thanked James Jones for accommodating his wishes.

The sentiment of ""we should have waited to see what he looked like in Vogels system"" dies today."
100,How good of an owner is Matt Ishbia exactly?,"He came in swinging his big dick and thought he could brute force his way to a championship on day 1.  

He traded away all our talented , great culture guys in exchange for a fading star, and set us back a decade.

This dude might be rich but he has shit for brains.  Let James Jones do his job:"
101,Who are some prove it players the Suns might try to target?,There are a couple teams that have a large enough cap space to take a lot of these names off the list. My personal opinion is targeting a Nerlens Noel but honestly I have no clue where dude has been
102,Enough with these casual hindsight takes 🤦‍♂️,"Everyone who's saying we shouldn't have made the Durant trade are the same people who rooted for it nonstop. People saying we tore a championship team down for Durant completely forget we just lost a 2-0 lead to the mavs the year before and we're hanging around .500 before trading for Durant. Everyone acts as if we went to the finals and made the Durant trade a week later lmao. It didn't work, so what? We traded our first round picks which will all be in the 20s and do you know what that equates to? NOTHING. Please go look at who the nets took last year with our pick, he played 2 games because he couldn't get on the court. Look at every draft from the last decade and tell me how many names you even recognize after 20. Cam and Allen are a wash. So essentially we lost Bridges (who is 28) for Durant. 

Would everyone be more happy if we stayed where we were and lost in the second round w cam and mikal year after year, or risked it all on a top 10 player in the history of basketball??? I swear, all these people with their dumbass takes started watching the suns in 2021 and have no idea what it takes to win a chip. We went for it and lost, but im happy we actually put our all chips in the middle and went all out because that's how championships are won 95% of the time. 

And holy shit, if I hear one more time that IT is the puppet master behind this team i'm going to lose it. As if IT is controlling Ishbia and by proxy forcing James Jones to make moves....when Jones had been working on the Durant deal before Sarver was ever forced to sell the team. Every IT rumor has been debunked, they are close friends and he sucks, but stop trying to find a scapegoat. 

STOP WITH THESE RIDICULOUS TAKES! If I hear one more post 2020 suns fan, who never cared about the suns or payed attention before we got good, I will lose my mind. BE PATIENT. These posts about trading beal durant and booker and unbelievable. Hell ya, I can't wait to go back to drafting Alex Lens and Josh Jackson's in perpetuity. Another full year with this team meshed together could do wonders and it's really our only option. Even the most delusional fanbase (Lakers) weren't trying to trade AD and Lebron after their string of postseason failures because there is no getting better than that, same with Durant and Booker.  

"
103,"[Woj] Free agent G TyTy Washington Jr., has agreed on a two-way contract with the Phoenix Suns, Kevin Bradbury of @LiftSportsMNGMT tells ESPN. ",
104,Does Lebron have a better shot at a title with the Suns or Lakers next season?,"With the news Bronny will work out for the Suns, the chance Lebron walks to Phoenix on a vet min has risen to something above absolutely zero. Obviously slim chance lebron walks away from a $120m extension and is probably using the Bronny workout in Phoenix to leverage LA into both the extension and drafting his son. But he said he wants to play with Kd and his relationship with James Jones is….something.

If instead of money, Lebrons main goal with his son is to win a title, does he have a better chance on the Suns or Lakers next season?"
105,Gambo: Rules out Dayton F/C DaRon Holmes II for the Suns at No. 22. Marquette PG Tyler Kolek is a player the Suns are interested in at No. 22.,
106,How did the suns go from having arguably the best future in the nba in 2020-2021 to now having one of the worst?,"Even though the Suns were not a championship team in 2020-2021, they still had an amazing young core with Booker, Mikal, Cam, and Ayton with all of their draft picks. Now their core is still Booker but also KD and Beal who aren’t playing as well as they did during their best years and probably arent going to get better over time. The suns are also completely drained of draft picks and any sort of young assets with their rest of their players on rental contracts. While I still think there is chance they turn things around and compete for a title, their window seems to be very short. I guess the 2021 nets and lakers wasn’t indicative of how you shouldn’t build a team to James Jones.

The worst fact of the matter is that Beal has a $56 million player option in 2026-2027. Gross"
107,"The best off season in suns history, turned to shit right at the end","No words, I'm actually upset at this"
108,Trading for KD wasn’t the mistake,"Suns had to give up 3 first round picks, Mikal and Cam. But thats the price necessary to get a MVP level player.

Lets be real. A core of Book, Mikal and Cam isn’t a championship core. It took those 3 and MVP level CP3 and a motivated Ayton to make the Finals. Those 2 are not in existence in 2024. At best the core of Book, Mikal and Cam are a 2nd round team. 

Having a KD/Book top 2 is a recipe for a championship contender. Getting KD wasn’t a mistake. The mistakes is what they built around the Big 2.

Suns desperately needed a PG and a defensive center if they were to trade CP3 and Ayton. Instead they got a more offensive minded center, two shooting guards and a wing. Seriously.

This team is totally different with a true PG and a solid defensive center.

Instead the Suns went all in on offense and scoring. Fine. Then at least hire a coach who can run a great offense. Nope. 

The mistake wasn’t trading for KD. The Suns needed another elite scorer to be a contender. The mistake is how they built around the 2 superstars. Instead of trading for pieces that fit, they went all in on scorers"
109,So many BAD moves after the KD trade,"KD move was good IMO. He is still a top 15 player and Book needed a legit scorer with him. 

The problem were the moves after that. 

Traded Dario for nothing. Would have been great to have Dario as a stretch back up center instead of Eubanks.

Getting rid of Cam Payne for nothing. Would have been great to have a backup point guard. 

Trading for Nurk. Big mistake. As bad as Ayton was at least he was decent at guarding pick and roll and could actually finish at the rim. Nurk is bad at both. There must have been a better trade out there. Nurk simply isn’t a playoff center when teams will pick on him the entire game. 

Trading for Beal. Dumb move. If nothing better was available then just keep CP3. Beal’s contract is a total nightmare and trading 1st round swaps is brutal 

Not signing a single point guard. Come on

"
110,My favorite Suns Team (2007),"This season ended harshly & not in the fashion we would love due to some ref shit & the Spurs, regardless.... this team was fun & legit.

Look at Boston, Denver, okc, even wolves. They underwent several years of mediocrity while developing talent they either drafted naturally or got pretty close to their rookie years and nurtured them over several years of playing under the same system. 

The path forward is getting YOUNG talent. Trade KD to a win now team, get some first round picks back and let them develop with booker and Beal. Yes, this means we'll be bottom feeders for the next 2-3 years but booker will still be at his peak after that. That's the only way to salvage our future. 



"
114,Ishbia needs to decide if the coach or roster should be changed,
115,Is it time to quietly start shopping Booker?,"I already know I’m going to get a lot of hate for this post and I’ll get called a lot of names but hear me out here: this playoff performance confirmed our worst fears, that the Suns are drifting further and further away from a title. Beal can’t be moved because of his no-trade clause and because no other person besides Matt Ishbia would ever pay 50M a year to a guy who can’t stay healthy and because Beal put up big numbers for a team that was consistently awful. KD still has trade value, but not enough to fundamentally change your roster. Booker is still in his prime. He could fetch some great players and picks in a trade. It’s obvious right now that he’s not enjoying himself. I have no doubt that he’s going to force his way out of town so that he can be the 2nd or 3rd scoring option somewhere else and he can take some of this media pressure off of himself as well. He can talk all this shit about “be legendary” and everything else but he is not Kobe! He is not built to be an alpha dog, it’s not in his personality. The Suns have zero cap space and zero draft picks. If James Jones keeps trotting out the same “Big 3” for the next 3 or 4 years he’s going to have a fan mutiny on his hands. He needs to quietly start making phone calls and putting together a trade before Booker forces his way out and the Suns get pennies on the dollar for him. Seriously though, do any of you have any interest in watching this core of Booker, Durant and Beal run it back next year? I definitely don’t at all. "
116,How to fix the Suns,"I've been thinking a lot about how to fix our team and I've developed this plan that I know will work.

**1. Get a new coach**
We need a new coach that can get along with the players, Frank Vogel obviously lost the dressing room. I propose we go after Monty Williams, he has history with Devin Booker and coached him to the final. Additionally, after a lot of down years, he will be cheap to get. He's not the most tactical coach, so perhaps we bring in an offensive guru on the bench, I heard Kevin Young from BYU is meant to be the real deal.

**2. Get a real Point Guard**
We need someone who can run our offense, no more Booker/KD isolations. We need the Point God, the hall of fame point guard, Chris Paul. This guy is an offense mastermind, yes, he's a bit old, but that means he's experienced. I know he breaks down in the later rounds of the playoffs, but I'll happy to even get to the later rounds. He's also on a huge expiring contract, we should trade Beal for him and get rid of his contract. 

**3. Trade KD for some younger players**
Kevin Durant is too old, we need some young blood in the team. I propose we trade him for some young wings, the Brooklyn Nets want to contend, I think trading KD for Bridges/Cam Johnson + picks makes sense for both teams. 

**4. Get rid of Nurkic**
Nurkic is a great regular season player but is always injured and doesn't hold up in the playoffs. I propose we trade him for a younger center who will match up well with Jokic. A player I've liked is Deandre Ayton, a young do-it-all center from Portland. He's rumored to have attitude and motor problems, but I think the ""dog"" in Booker will be a good influence on him. 

**5. Get some good role players**
Obviously we're over the cap, so getting good role players is hard. We can swap Grayson Allen for Landry Shamet, who can do everything Allen can do for less. Some good free agents min guys include J Crowder, Cam Payne and Frank the Tank.

I think this all makes sense, I hope to see it soon."
117,"The Phoenix Suns are closing in on hiring Brooklyn Nets executive Matt Tellem in franchise’s front office, sources tell ESPN.",
118,So we cheering for the Pacers on Saturday?,"Still mad about that robbery but started getting over it now because there’s nothing we can but we can talk about how James Jones and the suns passed on drafting Haliburton, smh how do we fumble that? Bro is paying so great in Indiana imagine if he had him as our PG. Man this team would had been so elite."
119,Suns had turnover problems last season?,"Suns had turnover problems?

They just signed the two best assist to turnover ratio players in the league.

Tyus Jones had 7.3 AST to 1 TO last season.

Monte Morris was 9.9 AST to 1 TO.

Suns got their point guard(s).

Take a bow, James Jones."
120,Actual plan to fix the suns,"Suns have a leadership void, since CP left.

Suns have a backup PG void.

Suns have a dubious Head Coach.

**Solve all 3 problems by hiring CP3 as player-coach. **

CP coaches the team, and then subs himself in for backup PG and the close out games with middies.

Gets his suit back on for post-game presser. 

CP doesn't play when Scott Foster refs.

We sign Bronny and Bron for depth.

Play 5-out banana boat style to close games with Bron/KD in the front court, and Book, Beal, CP in the backcourt. 

Bron is head assistant in this scenario.

Someone make sure Ishbia is taking notes.

James Jones can round out the bench."
121,With the Announcement of the new G-League team and the fact that they will be playing right in Tempe its Just another piece that falls into place for Bronny getting drafted and Bringing Lebron in to follow,"From a money standpoint Bronny Will have the G-league games packed and because of the location Bronny will still be with the main team all the time and with his dad all the team. On the other side Lebron can watch Bronny play because the G-league games are just 20 minutes away.

This is already our team is Built perfectly if you just put everything around lebron running Point forward. James Jones connections, KD connections, Book and KD recruiting at the Olympics. Close proximity to LA, Hating on Dan Gilbert with Ishbia CP3 potentially following after the warriors cut him. it all fits."

Made this thread 3 1/2 months ago and there were still some Eubanks supporters (lol)

&#x200B;

Eubanks has a +/- of -108 on the season. The only Suns rotation player in the minus let alone in 100s our other guys who were minuses we traded in the Royce trade. Vogel and Eubanks love affair has cost us literally many games this season. I think someone from the FO told him he is fired if Eubanks sees minutes. This dumb fuck hopefully finally has him out of the rotation.

&#x200B;

Also he started Royce over Grayson which for playoff ball is the way to go. "

126,2005-2006 Phoenix Suns,"This was such a fun team. Coming off of a year where they surprised the league going 62-20 & made the conference finals everyone thought this team was in for big things... then they lost Joe Johnson & Quentin Richardson to the Hawks & Knicks. They then lost Amare Stoudemire for the entire season due to knee surgery. It was looking bad. But this team (largely due to Nash's abilities to elevate teammates) saw breakout seasons from newly acquired Raja Bell & Boris Diaw & young gaurd Leandro Barbosa. Newly acquired players like Kurt Thomas, Eddie House, & James Jones gave them solid bench minutes. And this team was surprising everyone again. Nash was his 2nd consecutive MVP. They picked up Tim Thomas late in the season who was huge for them in a few playoff games. They finished 54-28 & once again made a trip to the western conference finals. This team was fun as heck & Nash definitely deserved a 2nd straight MVP after being able to mesh this team together & make another deep playoff run. "

This team has 5 hall of famers still able to perform (6 total).  Will always have bron or cp3 on the court. 5% chance best case, but not 0.00001% imo. obv the most unlikely is lebron, but if it happens all bets are off - cp3 and klove are sort of obvious then - bron has to know this and know that he could get cp3 there as a package deal and get to play with an all-star cast close to home.  

also will leave this here as lebron keeps going out of his way to call james jones 'MY guy' - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNiNRri09_w"
131,No one should be safe ,"Hey everyone,

First post here but have been on the sub for a few seasons now. I’ve been a Suns fan all my life, and I’m not sure I’ve ever felt this down. The Beal contract cannot be restructured, and he has a no trade clause (don’t think any team is trading for him anyway). We all know the cap situation this has created. So with Brad staying, that means we have four options: 

1. Run the same “Big 3” back, clear out the bench, and basically hope to find some bench players that are competent (huge if because of cap space issue). Maybe miraculously find some PG who could play 20+ minutes that can elevate the team (don’t see how this happens considering cap space issue). 

2. Trade Book- Most valuable asset we have. Would get a good NBA player, maybe a role player, and probably a few first rounders. Miami kinda comes to mind since Butler is there leader and book doesn’t have to take that role since he’s incapable of doing it here. I’m a huge booker fan, absolutely hooper, hence why he has the most trade value. Reason for trading him besides that is it’s clearly not worked here, and Book hasn’t exactly been a leader in the locker room and I think the criticism that he’s soft is unfortunately warranted. 

3. Trade Durant- Once again, love him, absolute assassin. Still has good trade value. Can put a team like OKC over the edge. Could get a few nice players and maybe a draft pick or two. He is still playing at an elite level, so his trade value shouldn’t be much lower than what we gave for him. This way you keep the hometown star in Book, can maybe get a few good players around him, but you still don’t win a title with that team. 

4. Trade both- drastic, and admits complete failure which I’m not sure Ishbia is ready to do despite this disaster. Would get all the draft picks we lost back basically, a few decent to good players, trade them, and once again Beal is on a team tanking for picks. This sounds horrific, but after big bad Steve Cohen did a similar thing that Ishbia did and utterly failed, the Mets swallowed the bullet and did this with Scherzer (Bealish), DeGrom (Durant-ish), Verlander (book), and got significant prospects in return. I get it’s a different, but maybe the same logic could be used. Should Ishbia just bite the bullet, and blow up the ship? 

Finally- Vogel being fired is a given, but James Jones should also be given a pink slip. It won’t happen because Ishbia loves him too much, but he has been HORRIFIC the past few years, in critical years. Will never forgive not drafting Haliburton (I think he was in draft before 21’, and if so would’ve won in 21 if we had him). Not to mention, the Beal contract is so horrendous, it’s worth being fired over. 

Sorry everyone, this is a horrible time, and I hope we can all look back on this one day and laugh. Go Suns "
132,Royce O'Neale has fit the Phoenix Suns like a 🧤| Offense + Defense Highlights |,
133,We need more size,"James Jones made this mistake during our finals run. Saric went down and we had no big man depth, so we were forced to play Frank Kaminsky vs Giannis when DA kept getting into foul trouble.  
  
Now it's 2023 and we have an unathletic 6'9"" center behind Nurk, who's a foul machine. And to top it off we're running him out there with a 3 guard lineup. Lakers had 21 offensive boards today while our dudes looked like baby chicks reaching for a meal.  
  
We lost the finals due to lack of big man depth once. I swear to God, this can't happen again  
  
Edit: my point is we need another big for depth"
134,Kevin Durant and Devin Booker play basketball today,predict statline for our duo!
135,Help me understand how we got better from trading Ayton. Where are we better?,"Ishbia should definitely get his first ring, but only if Milwaukee decides to give him one. Why help out your opponent if you are not going to make your own team better?

They gave up 18 and 10 for a guy that is slow and might play 55 games. How does this trade actually make the team better? Where are they better as a team? What positions benefited from this enough to cover the giant difference between Ayton and Nurkic? If the trade had been for a great defensive center, that is not a walking injury waiting to happen, then I could see the benefit, but that is not what they traded for. If the trade had brought in a really solid starter at the 3 or 4, then I could see the value.  But the Suns did not get better in this trade, they got worse AND made the team that they may face in a final better. 

James Jones and Ishbia certainly made Milwaukee better, but PHX is worse off.

They had 4 very solid starters, now there is 3, an injury prone slow footed center and who? All of the potential ""5th"" starters are marginal starters at best.  

Plus they picked up another shooting guard, because I guess there are not enough of them on the team? He is also a dirty player that has a skill set that 3+ other players already have.  They did not get better at any position through this trade.  Is Allen any better than Okogie, Gordon, Goodwin, Diop, or Yuta?  Is it enough to take the huge downgrade going from Ayton to Nurkic to make your 8th or 9th player maybe a bit better?

https://insider.espn.com/nba/hollinger/statistics/_/position/c

11 Ayton
32 Nurkic

I certainly hope this works out.  But I do not see how this makes us better overall as a team."
136,"Mat Ishbia said he’s not going to get into the status of Frank Vogel.   “I have not had one discussion about my GM, my coach or trading players, now supposedly in the media. Not one discussion is being had.”",
137,Donavan Clingan,What are the chances Clingan is available in the draft?
138,Should have kept this man,"We should have kept Cam Payne. As much of a liability he could be at times, he would have been so great on this team. The Suns offense would be so good if we can just play fast break basketball but we can’t go over 3 straight games without having 20 TO.

Cam’s name is literally turbo, just let him gun it to half court and attack the D before they could get set. The last time he played with a smart big (Saric) he was being mentioned for a 6th man of the year award. He was a reason we were still competitive with Denver last year and would have given us another player that could put pressure on the rim besides for the Big 3. Instead we traded him for a roster spot for Bol Bol (who’s been amazing btw) and don’t even play him in the playoffs. James Jones really fumbled on this one.

"
139,Suns pick ,The suns workouts so far have all been second round picks my guess it we move the 2 first rounds we have to get some good players and get a second round and try and take bronny?
140,2024 Draft option - Oso Igahdoro ,"Now that the Lakers have their 2024 draft pick, we can move on from the Bronny drama and look at some other draft options. This sub hasn't been the cheeriest of late but with the draft coming up, it should be fun. Chances are your favourite Suns player was probably drafted by Phoenix. At # 22 for you consideration I give you Oso Ighadoro. The Senior Center out of Marquette. Ighadoro has two elite skills - passing and perimeter defence. When Nurk can't stay on the floor, Oghadoro can. It's on the offensive end however, where Ighadoro can make the biggest difference to our team. James Jones talked about the challenge of getting the best out of KD and what is the best basketball situation for him. Well KD in my opinion played his best basketball in Golden State with Draymond Green alongside him.  Draymond Green's biggest strength - perimeter defence and passing. So whyy wouldnt we prioritise a passing big who can anchor our defence?  Kevin O'Connor from ringer gives him a comp to Al Horford and ESPN has him in a sleeper tier. Most conclude he has the skills to stick in the NBA. Sort of a nice pick up for us, right?  In the half court we could give the ball to Igahdoro in the paint and surround him with Beal, Allen , Booker and KD. Ighadoro could be a pseduo point for us with elite scorers cutting and moving into open spots for Igahdoro to find them. Hell I went down a rabbit hole recently with Bill Walton (RIP) and his time with the Celtics. Walton and Bird were an incredible pair. Walton would just find Bird in these spots where it was automatic. To the point it felt a like little cheating.  Now Igahdoro isn't close to Bill Walton but he's a modern big who has great vision. Watch that video and imagine KD and Book on the receiving end. Honestly watching the 86 Celtics was like poetry and by taking Oso Igahdoro we have a chance to emulate one of the greatest offensive in NBA history. "
141,Excerpts from the latest post by The Athletic on the Suns being swept and what happens next:,"> Sources briefed on the situation told The Athletic that Phoenix will take a hard look at making a full coaching change or, at the very least, discuss adjustments to Vogel's staff.  General manager James Jones, however, is expected to continue overseeing team-building for the Suns, those sources said

&#x200B;

> For his part, Vogel said before Game 4 that he is confident he will return next season, adding that he has the 'full support' of team owner Mat Ishbia

&#x200B;

>Across the season, (Kevin) Young was in charge of the Suns' game plans on the offensive end, which featured a heavy dose of pick-and-rolls for Booker and Beal. But Phoenix's players questioned the coaching staff's inability to structure the offense and maximize the output of a lineup featuring three of the game's best scorers, per team sources.

&#x200B;

>Sources briefed on the matter told The Athletic that Durant never felt comfortable with his role in Phoenix's offense alongside Booker and Beal this season... Durant had persistent issues with the offense, feeling that he was being relegated to the corner far too often and not having the proper designs to play his strengths as the offense was built around pick-and-rolls.

&#x200B;

>After head-scratching losses, it was easy to wonder if the Suns had enough leadership inside the locker room to help them navigate adversity. Durant said this week that while every Phoenix player had a voice - the freedom to bounce ideas and be heard - ""the coach is the leader.""

&#x200B;

>The Suns now enter the summer planning to build around their top six players in Booker, Durant, Beal, Allen Nurkic and Royce O'Neale... Phoenix officials hope to retain O'Neale as a free agent this season.  
>  
>  
>  
>The Suns could also look to bring in additional locker room presence, which was filled late in the season by Isaiah Thomas and Thaddeus Young.

142,What are your thoughts on us Drafting Zach Edey with our 1st this summer?,"He get double constantly in college which no one can do if he plays with Book KD and Beal.

He is a massive player as 7'4+ 300+ lbs.

He played with the Canadian National team in FIBA

Seems like the perfect guy to let Vogel Mold into the exact NBA center frank is known to coach.

Mock drafts seem to be split right now if he will go before or after our pick. But we could always try to trade up by swapping our future picks again.

I can just Imagin KD Bol Bol and Edey on the floor together. so much length."
143,[Daily Discussion Thread] 12/07/23 It Was A Busy Day Yesterday,"Well I had a fun day yesterday banning Laker trolls, I think that helped a little.

Pf: KD, Yuta, bol, Bates-Diop, wainright

C: Nurkic, Eubanks, Metu, Azibuke 

S.Lee would be a 2 way and possibly Azibuke, but that’s 19 players on our team rn.
Surely we must have more up our sleeve and maybe we can get some picks back? 

Do y’all think the suns have something else up there sleeves other then waiving possibly Johnson or wainright?"
148,One reason we SUCK in the 4th,"We suck in the 4th for various reasons.

A couple reasons that have been brought up before: slow pace, too many turnovers, too many injuries and refs.

Here is another reason: On average KD and Book only share the court for 3 minutes in the 4th.

Usually Book plays the entire 3rd so he rests the first 6 minutes of the 4th. Then Book comes in and KD and Book stay on the court together for about 1.5 minutes. Then KD rests for about 3 minutes. Then KD comes back for the last 1-2 minutes. 

So Book and KD share the court for only 3 minutes in the 4th. That means if Beal is struggling or Gordan/Allen not shooting well it will be a problem. 

Some games KD doesn’t rest in the 4th. But then you risk KD tiring out. 

Is there a solution? Maybe change the rotations a bit? Could Book have a 3 minute rest in the 3rd? That way he can come back in the fourth earlier. That could allow KD and Book to share the court for 6 minutes in the 4th instead of 3.

Suns want KD or Book on the court at all times.

They will average 36 minutes a game.

That means they will share the court for only 24 minutes a game. Right now its:

1st Qtr - KD/Book share court for 9 minutes 

2nd Qtr - KD/Book share court for 3 minutes 

3rd Qtr - KD/Book share court for 9 minutes 

4th Qtr - KD/Book share court for 3 minutes 

Can there be a shift to have more 4th quarter minutes?

Or can they risk having KD and Book resting at the same time for a few minutes in the 2nd and 3rd quarter?"
149,Less than 50 games left - Whats the best winning rotation?,"I think Nas should start over Grayson. The guy is 6’ 6” and can be a nuisance on defense. Plus the bench could use a scoring boost. In the playoffs the suns will likely have to contend with Luka, Kawhi, or Lebron. Unless James Jones pulls a rabbit out his ass at the trade deadline, and manages to land a coveted 3-and-D guy, Little is our best point of attack defender."
150,Thanks for the suggestions everyone! There was a clear winner imo…,

The suns have none of that we have been overhauled from top to bottom. New ownership, coaches, and players. When you have a set routine and muscle memory getting through the regular season grind is easier. You're just repeating the same systems over and over.
