What will happen tomorrow night? Will we continue to load up on assets by trading out? Will we take someone like Houston hero Jamal Shead? A backup big instead?

The Reed pick seems to be heavily in part due to input from Eli Wittus and the analytically minded in the Rockets. They may make a choice again at 44. After Sengun and Tari, I’m inclined to trust them. [This is Kevin Pelton’s analytics-based ranking of the 2024 draft for reference](https://archive.ph/bPOBi).

8,Rockets GM Rafael Stone sees Steven Adams as dominant rebounding force,
9,The problem is Rafael Stone/scout department/development team,"In the last 3 drafts Stone picked 9!!! 1st round picks ,most of any other team in NBA and only one player looking with all star/all nba potential.

1)I think the biggest mistakes were made in 2021 draft. He picked Jalen over Mobley,Barnes and Wagner

I dont blame him over Garuba pick because he had potential.
But Josh Cristopher over Hyland,Cam thomas or even Grimes was a bad pick.I Dont even mention herb Jones because was a longshot.

Ofc Sengun pick was good.I think everyone could see potential in him but his height/speed were the biggest questions


2)In 2022 we didnt have many options with no3 pick and i think Jabari can be a 3rd/4th guy in a championship team.

Eason was the safest pick at the time.he had the best advanced stats among guys left in the lottery.He is a good role palyer.

TyTy was a waste of pick


3)In ths years' draft.we lost in the lottery .by not picking 1st

We have to wait to see if we picked the wrong Thomson.
Whitmore was the pick with the most upside among players left so an easy pick.One more time.



Long story short,the biggest swing was Jalen.Mobley is one the best complementary  players along Sengun.Only Wemby or Chet would be better.

Now we need one more guy to rise .

Our best chances right now are if we sign Jalen cheap and somehow firure out his groove in the next years.or Jabari take massive steps in development.

Whitmore or Amen we have to wait and see what they can do."

19,Open Letter to Rafael Stone,"Dear Rafael Stone,

I hope this letter finds you in high spirits. I am writing to share our deep hopes and beliefs regarding the potential addition of the tremendous talent, Bruce Brown, to our Houston Rockets family under your leadership. The possibility of Bruce Brown joining the Houston Rockets is not just about the trade of a player; it is an event with the potential to bring a bright light to the future of our team.

Bruce Brown is not merely a basketball player; he is also a visionary and a leader. With him, the Houston Rockets will transcend being just a team. The leadership, courage, and competitive spirit demonstrated by Bruce Brown on the court are qualities that will not only win over the hearts of a team but an entire community.

Possessing unique defensive skills, Bruce Brown will not only control the game but also alter the overall dynamics of the team. His presence will contribute not only to the scoreboard but also to the team spirit.

Bruce Brown's offensive skills are not just a showcase of talent but resemble an artwork. His ability to emerge in challenging moments and take responsibility for his teammates makes him not only a player but also a leader. He has the power to transform each player on our team into a better version of themselves.

Mr. Stone, we have a deep belief that under your leadership, the Houston Rockets are about to embark on a brand new era. Bruce Brown joining our team is not just a trade; it is the beginning of a success story. We appreciate the determination and skills you and your management team have demonstrated during this crucial trade process.

In the event that Bruce Brown becomes part of the Houston Rockets family, we see this moment not only as a basketball event but also as a union of a family. We sincerely congratulate you on your leadership in this exciting journey.

And finally, eloquently conveying our sentiments with the unparalleled chorus from the greatest musical luminary of all time, the incomparable Taylor Swift, heralded as the pinnacle of artistic brilliance in the illustrious tapestry of American history.

Like a rocket to the moon, 

With Bruce, we'll reach the stars soon. 

His talent shines, a beacon bright, 

In Houston, together, we'll take flight.

25,There is a CONCERTED EFFORT by Mainstream Sports Media to DESTROY the ALPI SENGUN/ JALEN GREEN CORE,"Its quite shocking to see such ubiquitous proliferation all over social media/internet of the new mainstream sports media narrative about the rockets and their winning streak:

""Can Sengun and Jalen Green work?""

""Has Sengun held Jalen Green back all this time?""

""Do the rockets have to choose one and trade the other?""

Dear Patrick, Tillman and the rest of the Fertitta family,

if you see this,

DONT FALL FOR IT.

They (nba ruling class) are scared. They realize the rockets are creating a monster core and they want it broken apart because the rockets are not following the script...

Script says this year rockets should only be ""developing"" this year and by god, adam silver and company have already written the script out this year: Steph vs Lebron in the play in. Why are the rockets trying to mess that up?

""WAIT YOUR TURN""

Its not just mainstream sports media, ITS HOUSTON MEDIA AND HOUSTON ROCKETS FANS falling for the bait and have started the narrative that sengun's been holding back green all this time and that eventually, they will have to trade one or the other in order for either to fulfill their true potential....

Its pure chaos programming meant to influence rockets ownership to disperse a lot of these talented players the rockets have started to accumulate. I see this all the time being implemented in non sports situations but ive seen an uptick with this in sports due to sports blogs, message board forums, all these locked on, sportsmap, sbnation sites/social media channels that cover all american sports team. Its not just politics that have these false narrative programming in order to ""instigate/influence action"" that the powers that be want.

This happens all the time in sports from trying to influence organizations on how drafts SHOULD GO (you must draft this guy because we have projected them this way, if you deviate, you are on the hook if the draft pick fails) to trying to influence a trade by inflating a guy's value through media (most shameless and blatant example i can remember was espn promoting KYLE LOWRY IS THE GREATEST TORONTO RAPTOR IN HISTORY when the raptors were trying to trade him) or punish someone for some perceived infraction (sterling mess, pick any draymond incident, any cases of perceived racism)....i can make an entire subreddit on this issue alone.

Its not even a conspiracy theory at this point...

Far too much evidence.

Do i need to reference r nba threads that show how blatant and shameless the nba refs have been in favoring the lakers just this year alone?

r nba has pretty much scientifically proven it especially that thread about how the lakers get so much free throws despite them being ranked so low in terms of driving to the hoop.

Let's not forget the in season tournament where the clippers and lakers were in danger of being knocked off quite early and of course, the rockets came to town trying ""change the script"" that silver and his cronies have written out....and what happened during those games this year? The clipper game were harden hit the game winner was particularly egregious, the absurd calls the rockets got shafted all over that game...Rockets kept having double digit leads only for it to be erased with the whistle...then it turned the other way, clippers started getting double digit leads only for the rockets to keep whittling it down to single possession ready to get the lead only for....the whistle to make sure the script stays true.

You see it with the winning streak alone. NBA trying their best to end the streak and ""help"" secure the lebron vs steph play in. What was the free throw totals just before halftime vs okc? it was like 12-1 or 13-0 or something?

Heck, go see the boxscores for nearly all laker games during this winning streak. Anybody catch that bucks lakers game? Double OT?

PLUS NO LEBRON?

Laker Free throws: 30-32

Bucks? 11-17

That's with dame, middleton AND GIANNIS PLAYING!!!!

[https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/\_/gameId/401585673](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401585673)

LOL.

Go see the boxscore and the lakers starting line up free throw attempts. talk about LOL.

and it hasnt stop.   i dont even want to think about what the refs are doing for the warriors because that will just trigger harden playoff era ptsd...

and this isnt just some trivial inconsequential fan gripe, CURRENT RICH AND FAMOUS ACTIVE NBA PLAYERS are sick and tired of the corruption. Do i need to bring up rudy goebert and ant edward's frustrations and the fines they have occured for daring to speak on the shameless disgusting actions of referees????

This isnt some deluded fan thing or some upset nba player millionaire complaining because he didnt like a call that lost them the game.  We have ACTIVE NBA coaches and front office guys CALLING OUT THE SHADY REFEREEING we are seeing just this season alone!!!!

BEWARE OF SUBVERSIVIE INFILITRATORS

This is happening more and more lately. POSTERS FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS coming in and trying to influence the fanbase and eventually the ownership of the team to certain narratives and forcing moves that cause chaos and damage to the team. This sengun green false narrative epitomizes it.

Forget about the fact that its been a small sample size, forget about the fact that the rockets havent really played and beaten a great team during this streak, forget about the fact that jalen and sengun are complete opposites positionally and style wise and that when you start playing better teams, the rockets talent shortage will come into play, forget the fact that the rockets are missing multiple integral pieces like cam whitmore and tari eason....

forget the fact that alip started out playing in a more organized and competitive league in europe and that jalen's development was held back due to AAU and ignite deficiencies and that it wasnt sengun holding jalen back but jalen himself (should we take back all the dad buff, draya did it, jalen himself said his new baby has been an important aspect of his third year leap, said on camera to vanessa richardson after the road win vs the wizards....

There is a concerted effort by mainstream sports media to break up the rockets core because they need talent dispersed to rest of the nba and they need to start feeding the coastal elite teams who are getting old. Mainstream sports media have always despised southern non coastal liberal/progressive states when they win. Especially if they dont have a mainstream nike star like lebron or jodran or kobe.

DONT FALL FOR IT FERTITTA FAMILY.

DONT FALL FOR IT RAFAEL STONE.

It almost happened with jalen green to nets for mikal. the sports blogs, and mainstream sports media almost made that happen...."

30,[The Athletic] How the Rockets rebuild is accelerating ahead of schedule — with Houston star hunting at the trade deadline,"[https://twitter.com/TheAthletic/status/1752765037721289186](https://twitter.com/TheAthletic/status/1752765037721289186)

&#x200B;

*The* [*Rockets*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/rockets/) *are going star-hunting again.*  
 

*This might seem like a surprise to some, but a team that entered  Wednesday 22-24, sitting just outside of a Play-In spot as the 11th seed  in the Western Conference, has big aspirations to be buyers and not  sellers at this year’s* [*NBA*](https://theathletic.com/nba/)*trade deadline. Houston has proven it is capable of quality wins, having beaten the defending champion* [*Denver Nuggets*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nuggets/)*three times as well as the star-studded* [*Milwaukee Bucks*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/bucks/)*. But losses to the likes of the* [*San Antonio Spurs*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/spurs/)*,* [*Portland Trail Blazers*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/blazers/) *and* [*Chicago Bulls*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/bulls/) *represented unwelcome regression and have shown how far the Rockets still have left to go.*  
 

*Ime Udoka, the head coach in his first year in charge of the Rockets,  has been frustrated by the inconsistencies plaguing the team all season  long, with this roster still stuck in limbo, somewhere between  rebuilding and contending. For the 46-year-old who has won at every stop  in his coaching career, and who’s focused on winning at the highest  level, his desire to fast-track this promising program has been there* [*since he was hired in April*](https://theathletic.com/4446884/2023/04/24/ime-udoka-houston-rockets/)*.*  
 

*In fact, league and team sources say it’s Udoka’s insistence on making  the postseason, in tandem with the Rockets front office, that has  accelerated the franchise firmly into Phase 2 of its plan. Armed with a  profusion of young talent and draft capital, the Rockets have quietly  repositioned their internal strategy in recent weeks, and just about  everything is on the table in terms of potential moves they can make to  go get high-level talent that is ready to win immediately.*

&#x200B;

*So, why the sudden acceleration?*  
 

*Six weeks ago, Houston was 13-9 and firmly settled in the West playoff  picture, having won five straight games and thriving as the NBA’s  second-best defensive unit. Since then, the Rockets have been hit with  injuries at various points to the likes of* [*Dillon Brooks*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/dillon-brooks-8nCbv4hpPQdqLjbo/)*,* [*Jabari Smith Jr.*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jabari-smith-jr-jhkrxmmoChwb79CY/) *and* [*Tari Eason*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/tari-eason-eP9Dh0dR0KUnc6Ga/)*,  and the franchise has dropped 12 of its last 19 games. During that  time, Houston’s defensive efficiency has dropped to around league  average while its offensive efficiency has plummeted to the bottom 10.*  
 

*With the Feb. 8 trade deadline a little over a week away, the Rockets find themselves a game behind the 10th-place* [*Utah Jazz*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/jazz/)*.  There have been strides made this season, but several factors have  contributed to Houston’s slide in the standings — an uptick in schedule  difficulty, injuries to key contributors and an offense that is still  attempting to find consistency on a nightly basis. But the overarching  theme, stemming from Udoka’s mentality and approach, is that the Rockets  need to recalibrate and reinforce the aspects of their play that  afforded them success early on — even if that means turning their  attention to solutions outside of the current roster.*  
 

*At the beginning of the offseason, Rockets officials outlined — both  publicly and privately — their immediate goals: Improving the roster,  transforming the culture and pushing the timeline closer toward winning  basketball. Within the franchise, the period is commonly referred to as  “Phase 2” of a rebuild.*  
 

*But while it was clear Houston’s brass had been dissatisfied with how  the previous regime under former head coach Stephen Silas was unfolding,  charting a new course under Udoka still required some patience. No  magic wand could be waved to propel their situation into prosperity. The  Rockets, even with veterans Brooks and* [*Fred VanVleet*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/fred-vanvleet-DJq74red8aTFXbfg/)*added to the starting lineup and* [*Jeff Green*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jeff-green-XBMriOTOX3kgiOeB/)*,* [*Jock Landale*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jock-landale-4W0WKHuQR2WdG3pO/) *and* [*Aaron Holiday*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/aaron-holiday-CrX8pPvqqqV6MlVh/)*in the rotation, still would take some time to jell.*  
 

*Historically, the front office has believed every move or series of  moves should be through the lens of winning a championship, and if this  new-look team showed signs of legitimate improvement toward that goal,  even if it meant narrowly missing the playoffs altogether, that growth  would be welcomed.*  
 

*But Udoka, dating back to training camp last September, made it clear he  was ripping out the old floorboards from their foundation and wouldn’t  be content with settling for what he perceived as mediocrity. Udoka’s  appetite for winning is strong, hailing from the school of Gregg  Popovich in San Antonio and carrying that approach in Philadelphia,  Brooklyn and Boston. At one point, Udoka was two wins from winning an  NBA title. His ambitions weren’t suddenly going to change just because  his working location did.*  
 

*In a broader sense, the whole notion of winning, and the aggressive  approach to doing so, starts at the top with ownership, the Fertittas.  Having overseen a group that was on the cusp of an NBA Finals appearance  during their first season together in 2018, it was clear after three  years of languishing at the cellar of the NBA that they no longer had  the stomach for it and desired — and demanded — that things turn around  quickly. The voracious appetite for success also extends toward the  general manager, Rafael Stone, an individual who grew under his  predecessor Daryl Morey for years, watching just how desperate he was to  make it to the mountaintop.*

&#x200B;

*Udoka’s presence on the sidelines and in the locker room — in  addition to his strong influence with the franchise’s decision-makers —  has quickly shifted Houston’s expectations. Udoka was part of seven  consecutive postseason berths with the Spurs, including one title, one  Finals loss and a West finals finish. The 2019-20 Sixers (under  then-head coach Brett Brown) lost in the first round during Udoka’s one  season there, while the 2020-21* [*Nets*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/nets/) *(under then-head coach Steve Nash) lost in the second round.*  
 

*When Udoka came to Houston in the offseason, having elevated that* [*Celtics*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/celtics/)*team that came so close to winning it all against* [*Golden State*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/warriors/)  *in the 2022 Finals, his message was clear. He wanted a tough,  defensive-minded, trustworthy roster full of players who would attack  winning in the kind of way that runs counter to much of today’s NBA  ethos.*  
 

*Brooks, with all of his edginess and two-way energy, became an early  poster child of sorts when he signed a four-year, $80 million deal with  the Rockets in mid-July. And the decision to say no to* [*James Harden*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/james-harden-xj359Qh34ugWFbVp/)*,  whose long-rumored reunion with the Rockets didn’t happen last summer  because Udoka preferred the fit with VanVleet, was another strong sign  Udoka’s voice mattered a great deal from the start.*  
 

*Now, they feel they are ready to make the type of big move a contender would make.*  
 

***As it currently stands, the backbone of Houston’s roster is suitable for  the work Udoka wants to carry out — a veteran point guard in VanVleet  who can organize an offense, a tenacious wing in Brooks to stabilize a  defense and a versatile, vast-emerging big in*** [***Alperen Şengün***](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/alperen-sengun-c2JzOuogTXer3fD4/) ***who is developing rapidly.***  
 

*Elsewhere, though, as talented as the roster is, it’s evident there is  still a chasm between the Rockets and the teams firmly in the playoff  picture.*  
 

*Houston has been pursuing upgrades to the roster, searching for another  All-Star-caliber type who fits the two-way mold Udoka is looking for,  and the organization has the available resources to do so. The Rockets  have four first-round picks eligible to be traded — two via Brooklyn in  2024 and 2026 and their own in 2028 and 2030.*  
 

*Names that have been linked with them as the trade market has developed — Atlanta’s* [*Dejounte Murray*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/dejounte-murray-tm3kUMS7SqPU8gXQ/)  *and Chicago’s Zach Lavine — don’t appear to be enticing to the Rockets.  The Rockets have joined the long line of teams showing extremely high  interest in Nets forward* [*Mikal Bridges*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/mikal-bridges-dmZgViDJ3He5ZrQp/)*,  league sources say. Houston made an offer including multiple  first-round draft picks for Bridges in recent weeks, but the Nets have  zero interest in any deal involving Bridges, who is part of Brooklyn’s  core moving forward.*  
 

*At its core, rival executives believe it’s evident the Rockets want to  bolster their firepower and will do their due diligence to take swings  for a star — even if it costs them a blue-chip prospect part of their  core six in Şengün****,*** [*Jalen Green*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jalen-green-JvM9bnWhEgouBn16/)*, Jabari Smith Jr., Tari Eason,* [*Amen Thompson*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/amen-thompson-aGEkaVlRyeV3kR4n/)*and* [*Cam Whitmore*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/cam-whitmore-nYiYsk9W0nCWxXWk/)*.*  ***In 2021, when Green was drafted, or even as recent as last season, he  might have been deemed nearly untouchable. But Şengün’s emergence as a  potential building block under Udoka has made him a new, heightened  priority within the Rockets’ schemes.***  
 

***The 21-year-old Green is immensely talented, as evidenced by the 26.8  points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists on 47.4 percent shooting he is  averaging over the past five games entering Wednesday. But he averaged  15.6 points over the seven games before. As a defender and playmaker,  Green has taken positive steps this season, a credit to both himself and  the work done under Udoka.***  
 

***There have been several conversations — both with Green and Udoka and  also between Green and VanVleet — to find the optimal balance between  pace, rhythm and aggression. When Green performs as he did on Monday  night against the*** [***Lakers***](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/lakers/)***,  a 34-point, 12-rebound, seven-assist effort, his star potential oozes.  The key for Houston has been unlocking that on a nightly basis.***

&#x200B;

*The Rockets, league sources said, are also exploring the center  market, looking to bolster their rim protection. According to those  sources, Houston is keeping tabs on Utah’s* [*Kelly Olynyk*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/kelly-olynyk-Qlzp0cFJAKpYydgC/)*, Atlanta’s* [*Clint Capela*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/clint-capela-ZG4gOjeuHLppDkoO/)*, Chicago’s* [*Andre Drummond*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/andre-drummond-EMAr6CqGO9tooNht/) *and Portland’s Robert Williams III (who has fans throughout the current coaching staff) among others.*  
 

***Udoka’s preference is not only to find another big man who can step in  when Şengün is on the bench, but one who could potentially play  alongside him in certain lineups, akin to Williams and*** [***Al Horford***](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/al-horford-1bdxkLwov50QIyiQ/) ***during Udoka’s lone season in Boston.*** *Houston can offer expiring contracts in* [*Victor Oladipo*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/victor-oladipo-pq0wroLdaXy9NiOV/) *and* [*Boban Marjanović*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/boban-marjanovic-zSvTL2lK2s3m3ANW/)  *— or even longer-term salary like center Landale — in addition to draft  capital, such as second-round picks, to facilitate a deal.  Alternatively,* [*Jae’Sean Tate*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/jaesean-tate-fg6nYfCW1AXxn6jS/)*, who league sources said is attracting interest from the likes of Boston and* [*Phoenix*](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/suns/)*, is movable.*  
 

*Elsewhere, the Rockets would like to add another two-way ballhandler,  league sources said, one that can play both on and off the ball.* [*Malcolm Brogdon*](https://theathletic.com/nba/player/malcolm-brogdon-nZL21j2daIE6nIpI/)*,  currently playing in Portland averaging 15.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and  5.5 assists per game and shooting 41 percent from 3 is a name of  interest, league sources said. But, it must also be noted that any  addition in the backcourt could potentially reduce playing time for*  ***rookies Cam Whitmore and Amen Thompson — who team sources said are off  the table****, except for a deal involving a star player — which might cause  some hesitation in aggressively hunting for help.* ***In addition, Houston  is not interested in trading either Eason or Smith, team sources said.***  
 

*This notion of the Rockets being aggressive in pursuit of elite talent  is nothing new, of course. It was a hallmark of the Morey era from 2007  to 2020, and it’s worth remembering that Stone worked alongside the  former Rockets executive before he left for Philadelphia more than three  years ago. But the shift, it seems clear, is that the combination of  Udoka’s vision and competitiveness have quickly become the driving  forces behind this latest pursuit.*"

32,Team Performance Evaluation After 40 Games,"Before the season started, I said that I would reserve most of my judgement until we were 40 games in. We are currently sitting in 11th place in the Western Conference with a 19-21 record. If the season ended today, we'd be out of the NBA Play-In Tournament.

My predictions for the season had us winning 38 games in the least, or qualifying for the Play-In at the most. Both of these are still attainable, but it's starting to look bleak.

Fred VanVleet | B

FVV has proven himself to be what was advertised. A table setter on offense with a low turnover ratio. A leader on the court and in the locker room that inspires his teammates to be better. He's been a little disappointing as a scorer, as his shooting has been pretty inconsistent and his conversion at the rim has been terrible. Even still, he's been one of the more reliable players on the court when it comes to decision making.

There is something that I'm starting to notice about FVV that's a bit of a concern. FVV is one of the least efficient scorers in our Starting 5 (second worst), and he's taking a lot of shots. Often times, these are the kind of shots that would be advantageous for Jabari or Jalen to take.

Jalen Green | C

Jalen is in Purgatory awaiting his fate. Will he continue to struggle for the rest of season, or will he turn it around like how he exploded after the All-Star break last season? Does it even matter? The small strides that he's made towards improving his defense is overshadowed by his inability to find his game within the flow of the offense. From time to time he flashes his potential, which keeps me hopeful; but 90% of the time, he's looking like a role player at best.

Jalen has his work cut out for him this summer. The skills that he worked on in the off-season was clearly meant for a different offensive scheme. In other words, his summer was essentially wasted. He needs to work on his perimeter shooting, and not just set shooting. He needs to learn how to shoot from movement after navigating around a screen. He needs to add 15 lbs of muscle if he intends to be a threat when he's moving downhill.

Dillon Brooks | B+

Surprisingly he has shot the ball pretty well. It's been nice to see the so-called ""defensive identity"" of the team, not be an offensive liability. When he's locked-in on defense, he's a thorn in everyone's side. His communication is wonderful, and it's really cool to see him conducting our defense by telling people where to be. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be motivated to give his best on defense every game. He has his people that he wants to prove himself against, and seems somewhat disinterested in everyone else.

Jabari Smith Jr. | B

Bari's improvement from last season has been great. The amount of offensive production he's been able to give despite the number of touches has been good. He's the second most efficient scorer out of the Starting 5, and I hope we find ways to incorporate him more within our offense. His ability to stretch the floor is extremely valuable, but I don't want him to only be sitting in the corner waiting for a kick out pass. As his ability to read the game improves, I want him to learn how to cut to basket when Sengun attracts extra defenders during post-ups before he's too deep in the paint.

Like Jalen, Bari needs to keep working on his body. Talk to Giannis and figure out how he got stronger. As good as Jabari has been defensively, he doesn't do very well against bruisers -- the Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle, and Zion's of the world who leverage their body size on the court. He also needs to work on his handle and improve his ability to get to his spots on the floor like KD and Brandon Ingram does.

Alperen Sengun | A-

He's the only person on the roster that has an opportunity to make the All-Star Team this season. He's the only person shooting above 50% from the field (he's right up there with Joel Embiid around 53%) and FVV knows this. Alpi & FVV lead the league in PnR's, which has caught the attention of our opponents. The defense is cheating off of their assignments to double and sometimes triple Sengun as soon as he touches the ball in the paint. That's gravity -- that's an acknowledgement from the opposition that you are a threat. No one else on the team really has that, which brings me to the next subject.

Team Performance | C

We need actual shooters. It doesn't matter how well we space the floor if our guards aren't a threat from the perimeter. Both FVV and Jalen Green are shooting below league average. Good enough for it to not be a bad shot if they have a good look, but not great enough to pull players away from Alpi. Outside of an end of the quarter scenario, no one is aggressively closing out to stop Fred or Jalen from shooting 3's and that's a problem.

We don't have a Kevin Huerter, Duncan Robinson, or prime Klay Thompson, that can navigate around 1-2 screens pull up and let dat'thang go while still shooting 40% from 3. The dream is that Jalen will develop into a player that can do that, but it's not looking like he will. I think he can get close, but I'm skeptical that he'll get to a Jamal Murray level (39-41%). So while we continue to develop our young talent, we need to get some snipers on this roster because it's not fair to Alpi -- who has the talent and vision to facilitate the offense, but can't make assists because our guys can't hit shots.

Another thing that we desperately need is a competent backup big. Nothing against Jock Landale, but he ain't it. We need a center that can clean the glass and protect the rim. Someone who can get us at least 10 PPG if he's played 15 minutes, while being smart enough to make an outlet pass to the corner shooter when we're down 3pts in a win or go home scenario.

Coach Ime Udoka | B+

I love what he done as the head coach of this roster. He is what was advertised. The attention to detail, the accountability, the no nonsense attitude is what this young core needed. Some of his player rotations have been questionable, and I haven't seen him drum up anything offensively that impressed me; but defensively he's a beast.

I hope we find ourselves in a place where we can have more team practices because I think that's where Coach Udoka shines. It's essential for our young core.

Rafael Stone | C

While he's gotten us a ton of talent, it's clear that the talent doesn't fit together well enough to form a competitive team. We have a few guys that are still developing, still 1-2 years from being that thing we need, and his future hinges on them taking that leap. You cannot bomb on a #2 Lottery Pick (Jalen Green). Not in my eyes."
33,"We own the suns future, so we can get devin booker or get lucky on some talent in 2027 or 2029","This is basically the trade. Rafael stone is thinking about the future of this team. Adding devin booker means trading jalen green though, but the rockets now have leverage over the suns. ""Give me devin booker to give you back a chunk of your future""

35,End of the Season Team Evaluation,"For my mid-season evaluation go here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rockets/s/W8PWZ46MOj

As many of you are aware, I had us finishing the season with 38-42 wins. We finished with a 41-41 (.500) record -- that's one more win than OKC accomplished last year, and that's a 19 win improvement (largest by any team) from last season!! While we didn't qualify for the play-in tournament, we still outperformed the expectations of most media pundits.

Fred VanVleet | A

His leadership can't be understated. Bari said it himself in the presser -- Cam & Amen are lucky to have these vets in their first year. To the bewilderment of many who thought we overpaid for FVV, I don't think they fully knew what he had to help Udoka with on the court. So far he's earned every penny in my opinion.

With his most efficient scoring occurring this season, FVV was no slouch on the defensive end -- stripping the ball out of the hands of many players. Some of the best hands in the league at his position, FVV along with Dillon Brooks set the tone on the court. When he came back after being out for that hip injury, he deferred to Jalen Green and played off-ball despite his preference for playing in the half-court. He's also finished the season tied for 5th with Tyrese Haliburton for the best assist to turnover ratio in the league 😤

Jalen Green | B+

His Post All-Star Break performance (notably in March) salvaged his season averages. With a fresh set of legs, Jalen combined the defensive tenacity that Udoka was trying to instill in him, with the natural scoring talent that made him a high draft pick. Once he understood his gravity, his playmaking improved -- staying positive in +/- despite being double teamed and trapped throughout the game. 

He still had fluctuations in his offensive production, but he was rarely a negative on the court (until the final games of the season). If this is the new standard for Jalen Green's floor, then I'm very optimistic for his future on the team. Despite the negative press and a few self-inflicted wounds, he ultimately handled everything like a professional. Next season is where I expect the leap to occur 🤘

Dillon Brooks | B

As expected, he regressed to the mean. His shooting performance didn't last, but he still had one of his better offensive rated years here. As far as doing what we signed him for? Setting a hard-nosed defensive culture that doesn't back down to anyone? I believe he helped Udoka instill that quality into everyone.

Tari not taking shxt from Cam Reddish. Jalen not backing down to Bradley Beal. Cam poking his chest out to Devin Booker.  Bari willing to throw hands with Kris Dunn. Amen pushing Maxi Kleber to the ground after getting hooked. We got some dawgs who are hungry for their respect, and I believe we're going to earn it if we keep improving our defense and toughness. Despite losing Tari 22 games into season, we finished 10th in Defensive Rating and were hovering in the Top 8 for the majority of the season. 

Jabari Smith Jr. | B+

Despite going #3 after being a projected #1 pick, I believe Bari knows that he's going to be a role player on this team. A strong candidate for being a respected two-way player, Bari has done well for not having many plays drawn up for him (if any at all). He's got the potential of being our most versatile defender, and I hope he's able to turn into Giannis physique-wise in the future.

He was All-Rookie last year, and has improved his metrics across the board. He's still a bit shy of what I expected this year, but I'm impressed for the most part 🫡

Alperen Sengun | A

What a year for Alperen 🤩 Barring the injury, he was cementing himself as the centerpiece of the team. He earned himself a few all-star nods, and though he didn't make the team, I think everyone knows that he's a very special player. There's only 4 centers who scored more than 40pts on Wemby (Alpi, Jokic, Giannis, and Embiid) and 3 of them are MVP's.

With as much upside that Jalen has, Sengun also has a ton of potential. I don't think we've seen the best of Alpi just yet, which is wild because that means his floor is borderline all-star. Clearly our best player so far. I hope that he's closer towards being fully rehabilitated than Jock was at the beginning of the season. I'd like for Alpi to be able to improve his game over the summer or get some run in FIBA if he's not practicing with the team.

Amen Thompson | B+

The young man is a savant. He desperately needs to improve his shooting; but even if he doesn't, he's a Ben Simmons without the mental issues. He does so many things well, and he learns fast. For someone who's never set a screen until this year, he's pretty good at it.

If Amen is going to be a ball-handler for the bench unit, it'll be interesting seeing him in a PnR with Steven Adams or Jock Landale and having Tari, Cam, and another shooter for the kick-out 3. Watching Amen & Tari crashing the boards together is going to be awesome.

Cam Whitmore | B-

Definitely a dawg. Every GM who passed on him outside the 8th pick has probably lost sleep because of it. Despite not being primarily known for his shooting, he finished with a .359 3P%. He has the potential to leverage his physical gifts into being a 3-level scorer (possible 6th Man). He just needs to improve his handle, BBIQ, and FT%.

Team Performance | A-

With Amen & Cam getting more minutes and Jock Landale playing like the man we saw on the Suns in the playoffs. We had very little need for Jae'Sean Tate (who we should move on from) and Aaron Holiday (who we might keep, maybe). We could have flamed out after Alpi for hurt, but we bonded together and went on an impressive 13-2 run in March where JG4 seemingly ""turned the corner.""

We still need shooters -- hopefully a little more depth at the Small Forward and Shooting Guard position. I think we hold on to Uncle Jeff and Landale. See what we can get for Boban, Bullock, and Jae'Sean. Then use our upcoming picks for trade/draft capital to bolster the roster since we're likely not going to sign any of the guys we had on two-way contracts (though I do like Nate Hinton 🤔).

The team roster is starting to make a little more sense, and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We surpassed everyone's expectations except our own (to make it to the postseason), which to me was a long shot. The core group stays! Haters are in shambles! Let's keep developing our guys and make improvements on the periphery.

Coach Ime Udoka | A

The best acquisition we made 🤩 What a turnaround this coaching staff has made. The prescience to know that James Harden was not what we needed in order to bring out what we saw from Sengun and Jalen this year. That FVV, Dillon Brooks, and Jeff Green was the better play. Thank GOD for this man!

The work that he's done with Sengun, Jalen, and Bari all year was amazing 👏  Especially Jalen, cause I look around the league at these really talented players (e.g. Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Damian Lillard, Anfernee Simons) who are routinely a negative if they can't get it going offensively. If Jalen can just be neutral, it'll make it where no one will be specifically targeted on defense.

Rafael Stone | B

Saved by Jalen Green! If the month of March didn't happen like it did, hoo-boy he probably would have been out of here 🧐

The stars aligned (literally because we had the eclipse), and he's likely to be extended. Now he has to keep finding pieces for Udoka cause he's the only person I trust with the roster construction.
