0,When do you think Pat Riley retires?,"Not a shit post, just curious. I know he wants one final ring but the path is murky at best right now. 

He’s the Team President but he’s also 79 years old. Heat Icon, but at some point he has to pass the baton on. And to whom? Or who would you like to see take the reins and when?"

Miami didn't get to decide where Dame went anymore so than Dame did. It really seemed like Portland left Miami on read for months.

 Does Riley also think this Heat team with young players is better than Jimmy, Bam and a 3rd star like Spida? Yea I trust in Niko and Jaime, but to ffing rely on them rn and not like 3yrs from now is crazy. They're not ready yet to carry a team with Bam. And Herro was hyped up and praised Today? Maybe just to get his value up? Or was Riley just hyping up Niko and Jaime for trade value aswell to? 

Yea I'll admit, Niko does alot of things Bam, Herro, Winslow couldn't do at 20. He's still not ready tho, and isn't a point of attack defender or elite scorer. And Jaime is a young Jimmy kinda, but he still doesn't have a consistent outside 3pt shot. And his defense needs work kinda. "
29,DAE think that Pat Riley should do end-of-summer press conferences?,"It just hit me that for most of the sports teams that I support, I get to hear an explanation for how the offseason went at some point or another.

I’m not sure if Pat chose his press conference timing on purpose, but he gets to come in at the end of every season and sort of give the same responses about “always looking to improve” and “if there’s something out there” instead of having to answer hardball questions about how things ultimately played out.

Obviously this is how things have gone for forever, so if it’s not Pat, hopefully the next guy in his position will be willing to be a bit more transparent with the fan base."

37,Just listened to Pat Riley's press conference ,"Summary and thoughts



**ROSTER CONSTRUCTION**

- The message is clear with Availability. He brings up the Timberwolves, Thunder, Pacers and Celtics new group and how they play a lot of games. Mentioned about wanting to see the team play more just like these teams. ***( Interesting to take note is that the average age of these teams are younger than the Heat \[28.2\] who is in the top 5 oldest team in the league only behind the Suns, Clippers, Bucks and Sixers who have had injuries of their own as well.\]*** He was critical of the NBA's 65 game rule which allows player to be fine with missing 17 games. He wants 72 games out of his players. In the NBA, not everyone is 100%. 

- Stressed about the team retooling and never rebuilding/tanking. That's a discussion for another day on whether we should be more open to these things. 

- Mentions that he's not a fan of the NBA reporting injuries as teams can target those weaknesses in their games.

- Mentioned that there 8 tax teams and that the Heat are one of them. They are careful about entering the 1st and 2nd apron which limits roster construction. There are 2 or 3 critical players that they'd go for it and if he's going to handicap the team's future team building it better be the right move. He also mentioned about the importance of depth and how Ray Allen, Shane Battier, Chris Andersen, Mario Chalmers and Udonis Haslem helped them get the job done.

- Reflects back on when Lebron left, Bosh's unfortunate medical career ender then Wade left. Brought up how we missed a couple of times ***(Interesting to note that we we went 41-41 in one of the missed playoff years because of the tie breaker so one losing season before we got Jimmy. The one losing season was Wade's farewell tour.)***

- The last 5 years were great (2 finals appearances, 1 ECF and 2 1st round exits). He believes in this group and mentioned that it could have been 2 back to back finals appearances if Jimmy made that 3 against Boston. He believes that if the core doesn't get it done in 5 years, then there must be changes to be made as the core of Butler, Bam and Herro enters year 6 but just wants to see a consistent rotation. It's hard to evaluate this team as a whole when they all miss games and fail to build continuity. ***(We did see different alterations of this core with Dragic, got Lowry and we made the ECF and Finals in his 2 years with us and now Rozier. Some good productive players in Nunn, Olynyk, Iguodala, Crowder, PJ and now Love.)***

- He praised Boston and Brad Stevens. He's well aware of how Boston on how good Boston was as he watched the replay at the bar then his sleeping medication kicked in and went to bed then woke up and prepared for this exit meeting.



**JIMMY BUTLER**

- They mentioned that Jimmy Butler can request the extension when his window opens just like how he's always done in the past. There is no pressure on this and mentions that his last extension was given to him. They haven't made a decision on this as he still has a year left on his contract and they don't have to decide now. Either they accept or we're going to think about it as they haven't made a decision. Mentions that Jimmy Butler has 2 years left if he opts in to his player option.

- The reporter mentions that he has not played more than 64 games ever since arriving on the team ***(meaning he's not even meeting the NBA's 65 game rule)*** and him missing games on crucial games. His availability for the regular season has already been discussed with his agent Bernie Lee last year and he won't get into detail about it. It's clear that Pat Riley wants more from Jimmy. 

- If the non-Jimmy and non-Bam assets are not enough to get a quality player in return, is the team open to considering trade Jimmy? No, not right now.

- He's confident that Jimmy Butler is still 1A but just like anybody else and just like him and Spo, Butler also has to make adjustments on his overall routine and approach to the game. ***(He's a great playoff performer but he also has to show up in the regular season where sometimes he can be too passive and hopefully he realizes that shooting the 3 for the win doesn't help the team. I love that he's shooting the 3 more but that's not the shot I want at the end of games.)***

- He's not happy about Jimmy Butler on his trolling about beating the Celtics and Knicks if he was playing. ***(I think it's just frustration on Pat Riley because he believes we can beat them. As the reporter mentions, it's tough to think in hypotheticals. ""Don't talk it if you can't back it up"" is what I got from this. I guess they just have a different approach on this.)***



**BAM ADEBAYO**

- High praise for Bam. He believes he's already an All NBA player and they are happy to have him here. Mentioned about him expanding his game more and he should sit with coach and listen on what areas he can work on more. He brought up Magic Johnson who told him that they need to change some things and that he had to improve his outside shooting at the time when the league wasn't shooting that many 3 pt shots. 



**JAIME JAQUEZ AND NIKOLA JOVIC**

- Jaime and Jovic are great pieces and look to be part of the future. Brought up Jovic's back issues in his rookie season. His learning is off the charts and loved what he saw this past season. It's about just repetition, learning and more cardio. Great rebounder and a coast to coast guy.  He also loves Jaime Jaquez. If he hadn't gotten hurt, he'd have played the full 82 games not just 75. He did mention he had a rookie wall after the groin injury and different  it can be hard to overcome over the course of the season with the changing roles. Likes that they've done a great job on building through the draft with Bam, Herro, Jovic and Jaquez. They like their base. They like these guys a lot. 



**TYLER HERRO**

- When asked about Herro, right off the gate, he said that he's been fragile. ***(It's something you don't say if you're trying to raise his trade value even though it's well known)***. He appreciates that he's gotten stronger and puts the time in. He's gotten stronger but has some work to do and there are adjustments to be made. His major injuries are real. Says it's tough to handle the assignment against Boston with Butler and Rozier out. Hopes that one day he can come and get through a full season. He mentions James Worthy had injuries in his rookie and second year seasons and was able to get over it. Sometimes these things just happen with players. ***(James Worthy played 77 and 82 games his first 2 years so I don't know what he was talking about here.)***

  
**DUNCAN ROBINSON**

- Liked what he saw for stepping up when Tyler Herro went down but mentions that he wants to see the team play together more and see this team healthy. 72 games that's what he wants to see. He also mentions that they have do something in the weight room, nutrition and mental health. They will do whatever it takes to see what they can control to make it happen.



**UDONIS HASLEM**

- Mentions that he looks good on NBATV and ESPN. Him and Mike Miller are funny as hell on his podcast and said half of his stories were a lie.

- He disagrees with Udonis Haslem about his Tyler Herro comments and thinks he should have kept that to himself. He thinks Herro's a starter but ultimately it's up to Spoelstra to decide. ***(I think Pat Riley is well aware of Herro's limitations but just because he think's he a starter doesn't mean he also thinks he's on the same conversation with Luka, Trae and SGA.***



**TERRY ROZIER**

- No concerns on Terry Rozier's neck injury. Mentioned that Terry Rozier was wearing a neck brace and said that the doctors tell them that it will heal with time. He believes in Terry Rozier. He showed in games that he is everything he expected. 



**ERIK SPOELSTRA**

- Stresses that Erik Spoelstra deserves the contract they gave him. He believes in continuity and stability. He also mentions that he commands great respect from players all over the NBA on how he gives some players career years and opportunities. 

- Mentioned that Spoelstra should take a deep dive on the offense and defense. We were 21st in offense and 5th in defense. But more than these ranks, we should take note on the little things on where we rank in close outs, contests, block outs, loose balls and charges. These are things we must focus on if we don't win the transition game."

So we used to hangout when the family got together when I was a kid and somehow I never knew this man worked in the NBA. My grandma’s brother. Turns out he was the personal trainer for the San Diego Padres in the late 60’s before switching to the Rockets. Who did they draft in 1967 with the 7th pick? The Godfather himself, coach Pat. Unfortunately I only found the team photo from the 70-71 season and Pat had left for the Lakers by then, but it’s pretty cool to see he still had a different future HOFer on the team in Mr. Elvin Hayes. Uncle Barry is the 2nd from the left in the 2nd photo in the dark suit. He was also chosen as the trainer for the 25th ever All-Star game that year which is fuckin crazy?? 

He passed a few years ago and I found this box in the house grandma gave my pops lil whole back. The super mint 06 SI magazine and these old prints of Bill Russell were pretty cool, idk if he took them himself or what but they’re sweet. My grandparents had season tickets in the 90’s when coach Pat was still coaching and apparently he and Barry still had a relationship and would go back to the locker room and see him and stuff sometimes. I would have been a baby but like, was I ever there for that?

Watching this team, there are moments when our offense is so stagnant that we can't score a point for minutes at a time. As much as this sub loves to glaze Lowry, he is not good nor is he worth 30 mil. He has lost a step on defense and offense. Even though this is the case, he is still vital since without him in the lineup the offense becomes more stagnant Detroits offense. We need an actual point guard and backup guard. Hopefully Pat Riley sees this and gets an actual one. Now I don't think we need a star, but a good point guard and backup. 

My suggestions: Lowry and a first for Tyus Jones and Delon Wright. We get a point guard who can actually score and play-make. We also get a backup who can play-make and plays good D. Wizards get a valuable FRP and expiring salary for their rebuild. Of course Pat Riley actually gets paid to come up and do these trades, so hopefully he can cook up something frfr.

76,Pat Riley to the other NBA GM’s making offers for Dame,Obviously just for laughs in this stressful time.
77,Hot take: I don't like the direction the franchise is going and the front office is the problem,"I used to be all in on whatever the heat do, but the more I think about it, I more i believe the heat are stuck in no man's land and the front office is complacent. This team has been a play-in team the past 2 seasons and almost lost outright in both appearances. Idk how y'all don't get frustrated with this. I hate mediocrity. I rather the team tanks because at least a big reward comes from that, being a very high draft pick. Pat Riley doesn't want to choose a direction and only does enough to make the heat a decent team. Ik tanking is frowned upon but it is not entirely a bad thing. Tanking has created dynasties or periods of competitiveness that resulted in at least 1 championship (the tim Duncan spurs, Hakeem rockets, Ewing's knicks, Jordan's bulls) shit, even the Celtics tanked in 2006 and got the 5th overall pick, which they used to trade for Ray Allen. I'd rather my favorite team suck than be mid as fuck for a decade and continuously hope they do something (just look at the dolphins between 2009 and 2018) I think the Jimmy Butler heat have reached their ceiling. They can outdawg everybody in the east but they'll get destroyed by the western conference team, who is usually the best team in that conference. Making the finals is cool but falling short of winning it all is not. Not to mention Jimmy is getting old and Tyler is not improving drastically and taking the leap into a 25ppg scorer(which is what the front office is apparently hoping) I think this is the end of the road. Ik this will be down voted and I will be called a bad fan but these are my thoughts "
78,Could Marcus smart be a Heat tomorrow? ,What’s Pat Riley cooking 
79,How the Miami Heat offseason about to look in the next few months ,Can’t wait HeatNation

82,"Imagine if the heat make it back to the third round next year, and then have to get another dogfight with the celtics.","Let's say kel ware turns out to be a steal, and a really good player. Also Pat riley gets butler another superstar. Do you think we can get to the third round?"
83,Heat offseason 24. We know about the big projected trades like Mitchell and kd. But here are few realistic and cost efficient trades & signings the heat can make to improve their roster,"

Adding more bigs to the heat.
Moving bam to pf position 

Players 
Steven adams ,valanciunas ,are on expiring contracts.  They provide size and they can be effective on the boards 

Wild card big would be a guy like Andre Drummond he’s pretty much a walking double for cheap. 

Guard play 

A player like Alex Caruso would a great fit in Miami his contract is expiring.

He’s an athletic guard who is really good defensively and he can shoot.

Hawks guard Dejounte murray. 
He’s athletic guard that can defend and create his own shot. He’s another guy that would fit in well

Wildcard 
Russel Westbrook I know I know 
But I think he’s a bargain and he can still can play on both ends well. He still is explosive Russ with coach spo would be crazy pat Riley has been trying to get him since the 08 draft 

Solid role players at the sg/sf

Players like Kelly oubre 
Interesting he a solid scorer he is a willing defender.  He’s another guy that could fit in

Kj martin 
He’s young he’s athletic and he can defend pretty well.  A guy like this would work well with spo 

Scoring

Heat need a 23-28ppg scorer to play along with Jimmy 
They haven’t had one since the Lebron dwade era. 

Ideally kd would be great but I think it would deplete the roster 

Same with Donavan mitchell

84,The Godfather,
85,"The Heat have now lost 6 in a row. The last time Miami lost 7 straight was during the 2007/08 season, when we finished 15-67.","That was Pat Riley's last season as the head coach of the Heat.

Among the players who played for Miami: Shaq (traded to Phoenix mid-season), Alonzo (career ending injury vs Atlanta), Shawn Marion, Penny Hardaway, Smush Parker, Chris Quinn.

The only Heat to play all 82 games was Ricky Davis."
86,Who is the biggest rival for the Heat? Is it the Celtics or the Knicks?,"The heat had an intense rivalry with the knicks, which resulted in multiple brawls. Pat riley left the knicks for miami. The celtics have been facing the heat since 2010. And have been enemies that have hated each other since. The celtics and the heat have this interesting cat and mouse game going on."
87,Lebron would’ve won 5 if he stayed in Miami,He should've resigned with heat for atleast 2 more years to see what pat Riley could retool (obviously he would've retooled greatly with the pay cuts wade and Bosh were willing to take Still Bosh would have the clots but pat Riley was about to get pau gasol to sign with heat if Lebron stayed (thanks to the pay cuts from wade and Bosh) The goran dragic trade would've stilled happened also right? And Whiteside would still breakout. I think they would've won in either 15 or 16... then join Cleveland in 2017 and finally bring it home for CLEVELAND in 19 when the warriors were hurt.
88,What Jimmy Butler told @RohanNadkarni:,"“I feel at home, man. I really care about the city, I really care about the people in this city. Miami has embraced me. They’ve wanted me to bring them something they haven’t done since LeBron, D-Wade and C-Bosh. And I want to do that. So as soon as I get this knee back right, I’m right back on they ass and everybody know it.”  I feel like everybody got a pass this playoffs, man. We’re not going out like that.”

(To be clear: this was comments prior to Pat Riley’s presser)"
89,"Apparently Pat never even offered Tyler in any trade discussions this off-season, makes me wonder how seriously we even tried for Dame.","Either way we move, hope tyler balls out"
90,Here’s my final guess of what has been going on.,"Obviously there have been so many different reports from different guys, making it more difficult to get a grasp of situation. But based on these reports below:

* Gambo(Suns reporter) saying “I don’t think it’s the Heat but I won’t rule them out. Heard 3-4 teams in on this”  https://x.com/gambo987/status/1705327927968358440?s=46

* Woj saying recent talks didn’t involve Miami.

* Haynes saying Miami doesn’t know what the Blazers want and they haven’t engaged since Summer league

If you sum up all these reports, my guess is that Portland, trying to maximize their leverage, is

1) *completely* blocking the Heat all summer

2) Very actively talking to other teams in recent days (e.g. Raptors or Bulls) and receiving a best offer from each team

3) And will eventually engage with the Heat later, saying “We got this offer from this team, if you can’t outbid this offer, we’re sending Dame to this team.”

I think we’re between stage 2 and 3 right now. I think the Blazers will engage with the Heat after the Blazers know what they can get from other teams, and show it to Miami. Whether the Heat will try to outbid the other team’s offer or not is upto Pat Riley. 

Not to be a doomer but all these recent reports from Gambo, Woj, and others are not that encouraging at all.

92,Miami Heat Offseason Plans,"If you were Pat Riley, what would be your plan this offseason?

Plan A: All in for Donovan Mitchell: Trade Herro, Jaquez/Jovic and a few firsts

Plan B: All in for someone like Trae Young: Similar package as would be for Donovan

Plan C: Trade Herro + filler for 3 & D lockdown defender, let Rozier run the offense while our defense will be suffocating (Imagine we did this for OG) 

Plan D: Trade Herro + filler for a center like Myles Turner (they won't trade him to us but someone like him). Play Bam at the 4 where he fits more naturally while still having space to work with on offense and would be extremely difficult trying to score in the paint against us 

Plan E: Trade Jimmy for another all star and retool with a younger team of all shooters + Bam. Would erase our spacing problem but we would be down the leader and closer of the team 

Plan F: Run it back 

Plan G: Anything involving bringing in and paying an out of their prime older all star a bag (PG, Klay)

94,Realistic offseason discussion,"If you’re reading this, your hospital Miami Heat were bounced in the first round by Boston, who can go fuck themselves. Whatever, it's time to talk about where we go from here. How do we get this team over the hump after half a decade of almost? Well, let’s look at our cap situation: 

**Tradeable Contracts:**

Jimmy Butler – 48,798,677

Bam Adebayo – 34,848,340

Tyler Herro – 29,000,000

Terry Rozier – 24,924,126

Duncan Robinson – 19,406,000

Jaime Jacquez Jr – 3,685,800

Nikola Jovic – 2,464,200

**Tradeable Picks:**

2024 FRP (Very unlikely Miami trades the #15 pick in this draft. Would have to be a draft night trade where we pick the player for another team. Again, extremely unlikely unless a top 10 star announces they want to be in Miami before the draft)

2026 SRP

2030 FRP

2031 FRP 

**Expiring Contracts:**

**Caleb Martin** - Player Option 7,126,900 (Likely opt out and we let him walk. He will probably get more money somewhere else)

**Kevin Love** - Player Option 4,027,525 (I could see Love opting in. He won’t get much more anywhere else, and he likes it here)

**Josh Richardson** – Player Option 3,051,153 (Probably opts in because he missed half the season with his injury and likely won’t get much more anywhere else)

**Thomas Bryant** – Player Option $2,845,342. (50/50 on this one but Bryant could easily opt in. He didn’t play a ton for us, but he usually left good impressions when he did. His lack of playing time here though means the market for him would be very small elsewhere, so why take a minimum somewhere else)

**Haywood Highsmith** – Unrestricted Free Agent (Big question mark what Highsmith’s value is around the league. He’s a very good defender but not much else. He could sign a longer-term deal as a bench rotation piece for us, but I’m not giving him much more than minimum money for 2 years with a Team or Player option. If I had to bet, I think we move on from him)

**Delon Wright** – Unrestricted Free Agent (We don’t have his Bird Rights, so he’s probably gone unless he re-signs for the minimum with us)

**Patty Mills** – Unrestricted Free Agent (I doubt he’s back with us next season. Maybe he goes back to San Antonio for one final year before retirement?)

**Orlando Robinson** – 2,120,693 Non-Guaranteed (We’ll probably guarantee his salary as a back bench rotation piece)


We are a First Apron team. What does that mean? 
•	We can’t take back more money in trades than we send out.
•	We can’t use any of our trade exceptions unless we create a new one in a trade over the summer. 
•	We can’t sign outside free agents above the minimum. 

**So, what are Miami’s options this summer?**
Okay so let’s get this out of the way first, we’re not blowing up the team this summer, or going into a full rebuild, I don’t care what any nephews think. One, Miami has never done that and two, the protections on our picks to OKC and Charlotte mean we can’t rebuild using lottery picks anyway. So, Miami will probably retool around Butler and Bam. That said, we’ve been a play-in team for two years in a row. Something has to change. Now I’m not going to touch on the subject of Jimmy’s extension here. That’s an issue I have no insight into whatsoever, but Pat and Andy’s thinking on that will certainly affect what moves we make this summer. Also, none of this takes into account any huge developments like Embiid asking out of Philly, Mitchell asking out of Cleveland, Lebron asking out of LA, or Durant asking out of Phoenix. Any of those things happening would blow up everything below and would mean we look at any and all options outside of Jimmy and Bam to bring one of those guys here. 

I also doubt we trade Rozier unless we can package him with Tyler for a top 10 player. We’re almost definitely not trading Jacquez, again, unless it’s for a top 10 player. I could see us trading Niko if the right deal comes together. Our most likely trade candidates are Tyler and Duncan. Tyler’s value is pretty low right now because the league sees him as an injury prone, inefficient 3rd option, but after 5 years in the league, he is what he is. His value isn’t going up. If Duncan can play like he did this season, then his expiring contract potentially has a lot of value for teams, but many might also see him as a Miami system player, so his value is diminished as well. Either way, we’re selling low on both these guys.  

This team needs size and scoring punch in the starting lineup, in addition to better role players to cover the minutes that Bam and Butler are on the bench. We can’t keep relying on minimum contracts, and rookies to shoulder the burden.  


**Trade Options for Size That Can Pair With Bam:**

**Brook Lopez (MIL)**– Probably the best fit out of anyone on this list. He’d solve a lot of our height issues, he’s an All-NBA defender, a great rim protector, rebounder, and floor spacer. Milwaukee will probably get boucned soon by Indiana and they’re desperately lacking draft assets after their many trades, so is it time for them to break up Giannis’s supporting cast, who seem to have hit a wall since their championship?  Pulling off a trade for him is tricky because of our First Apron restrictions and the Bucks Second Apron restrictions. We can’t take back more money in trades, neither can they, plus they also can’t aggregate salaries in trades, so they can only trade Lopez straight up. On paper a trade of Duncan, Niko, Orlando Robinson, and our 2030 FRP works.  The question is, would Riley be willing to give up our last tradeable first for a 36-year-old Lopez and would the Bucks go for a move like this that makes their defense and rim protection significantly worse but improves their outside shooting around Giannis? 

**Brandon Ingram (NOP)**– He’s on a manageable 36 million expiring deal and there’s been trade chatter around him all season, plus the Pels just got swept. He’s not a great rebounder or a good defender, but he’s a good floor spacer, and provides offensive punch. They already have McCollum on their roster, so Tyler would likely be redundant to them. They need a PG, so a trade could look like Rozier and Duncan for Ingram. I wouldn’t give up any picks in this scenario. The Pels get a score-first guard, and a great 3-point shooter. We get a good 4 that can space the floor some. We would then need to find a point guard, so if I’m Pat, I only do this deal if we have a starting point guard lined up. Caruso please? 

**Jerami Grant** – Obligatory Fuck Joe Cronin.  

**Kyle Kuzma (WAS)** – Kuzma doesn’t strike me as a Miami Heat player, but we know the Wizards tried to trade him this year and he said no. He might want to play for Miami though. The Wizards are a tanking/rebuilding team and Kuzma doesn’t really help those efforts. They also have Deni Avdija who had a breakout year for them, is much cheaper, and could easily replace him in their lineup. A straight up swap of Herro for Kuzma works. I don’t know that that moves the needle much for us though. Kuzma is an inefficient shooter and a bad defender, but a decent rebounder.  More moves would be needed after this. 

**Rui Hachimura (LAL)** – Lakers are in the same spot we’re in and will likely want to rebuild around Lebron and AD. They already have Reaves as their starting SG, so I doubt they would want Tyler. That basically leaves Duncan as our main trade chip for Rui. Luckily the Lakers were one of the worst 3 point shooting teams in the league and Duncan can help there. Dunc plus us returning the 2nd that LAL owes us should get it done. One caveat to this is DLo. If he decides to opt out, which looks likely, then LAL might be open to trading for Tyler. In that case, I’d offer Tyler to LA for Hachimura, their return of our boy Gabe, and an LAL FRP. This move wouldn’t be a huge improvement for us, unless Gabe gets back to his old form, but hey, we get a potentially high value FRP out of it because by then, Lebron might be out of the league. I can’t see him playing much more than 3 years.  

**Harrison Barnes (SAC)** – This could be a small but fairly easy upgrade if the Kings are amenable. Swap Duncan’s expiring plus our 2026 SRP for the last 2 years of Barnes’ contract. We get a starting caliber 4 that’s a more physical player than Duncan, and the Kings get a better 3-point shooter, plus they free up more space under the first apron in 2025-2026. 

**Nikola Vucevic (CHI)** – Good rebounder and floor spacer, though he was atrocious this past season, also awful at defense. He’s not really a player that contributes to winning as we’ve seen with his stints in Orlando and Chicago, but his trade value is extremely low so he’d be relatively cheap. Duncan and Orlando Robinson for him should get it done. Chicago gets cap space in the 2025 offseason with this deal and Miami gets two years of an older, slower, and much more expensive version of Jovic…yeah I’d rather just keep Jovic.

**Jarred Vanderbilt (LAL)** – He had a bunch of injuries this season, so his value is low. He’s not a great fit with Bam though. Not a good three-point shooter either. He would be a bench option for us. He'd also have to come in a package with another Lakers player because his salary is low. 

**Gordon Hayward**– This could be a weird one. He’s no longer that good of a player but he’s a decent 3-point shooter. He isn’t a natural 4 and doesn’t improve us much so he’d be more of a bench piece. Given his history with Rozier, maybe we can entice him to come to Miami finally. We know he was very close to signing with us way back. The main problem is he’s a UFA this summer so he’d either have to sign for the minimum with us, which I doubt he does, or OKC could sign and trade him. In this scenario, we could only sign and trade for Hayward if it puts us under the First Apron. We would also be hard capped at the apron in 2025-2026. With all those things considered, I highly doubt Hayward comes here in an S&T.  

Other options I didn’t consider because we likely don’t have anything their teams want: Julius Randle (NY), DeAndre Hunter (ATL), Jaren Jackson Jr. (MEM), Cam Johnson (BRK)"
95,For the people that dont use facts and blindly repeat narratives:,"[https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2024/05/jimmy-butlers-agent-responds-to-pat-rileys-comments.html](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2024/05/jimmy-butlers-agent-responds-to-pat-rileys-comments.html)

""Speaking to Winderman, Lee pointed out that Butler’s minutes per game average this season (34.0) was his highest since he joined the Heat and that he was one of just a dozen players aged 33 or older who played 2,000+ minutes in 2023/24.

While the star swingman was unable to play in the first round of the postseason vs. Boston due to an MCL sprain, he has logged nearly 2,500 playoff minutes (essentially a full season’s worth) since arriving in Miami. That workload should be factored into the availability discussion, Lee said, adding that he’d like “a little bit more clarity” on Riley’s comments.

*'The thought that Jimmy is picking and choosing when to play isn’t reality,”* Lee said. *“I enjoy watching him play as much, if not more, than anyone. So believe me, I want to see him play every night. But unfortunately he isn’t a robot and injuries and circumstances happen. Prior to the year, we had a meeting to discuss the changing* [*NBA rules*](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2024/03/hoops-rumors-glossary-65-game-rule.html) *and the need to reject load management, And we all understood the assignment. Jimmy’s 22 games missed were all for valid issues and concerns.'  ""*

also if you were to look at MOST, if not all superstars before this year, they all played like 50 - 65 games per year. The only reason they played more this year is because of the new rule (want to qualify for end of season awards). Jimmy missed 22 games out of 82 (not half the season, as some of you like to say) mainly because of injuries and the death of a family member. And none of the other superstars who played more this season had anywhere close to the amount of games/minutes jimmy has played in the playoffs over the last five years (and theyre much younger than jimmy). When you factor all that its hard to think of a superstar who has put their body through more abuse for their team over the last five years than Jimmy has. Stop with the recency bias."
96,The Raptors package is a bluff,"A Raptors package of OG + Dick + pick + pick swap is a very, very risky proposition for both teams. Blazers would need to convince OG to stay. Otherwise, it’ll be just Dick + 2 FRP for Dame. At best, the trade is equivalent to 3 FRP and 1 young player. At worst, it’s 2 late FRP and 1 young player. 

To explain, let’s keep in mind…

OG is not a flippable asset. He’s due for a big payday as a UFA and teams who want him can afford to wait until summertime. In the event that there is a contender that’ll pay for an OG rental, that is going to be 1 FRP at most (SRPs too but that’s really not that relevant) and is guaranteed to be a late pick. This package’s max value is equivalent to 3 FRP + Dick.

Let’s also keep in mind that if the Raptors give up OG, they’ll be missing a defensive centerpiece necessary to make them real contenders. OG is defensively like Bam in a wing player’s body. If he’s traded, it’ll be difficult to convince Dame to stay with what is essentially Blazers East. The same applies on the offensive side if Siakam is traded instead of OG. The only player who is valuable but whose leaving won’t impact the Raptor’s current competitiveness is Barnes who is considered untouchable. It’s an uphill battle for them. They are not a 50+ win team like during the Kawhi trade. They missed the play-in last year by a few games. Just like the Blazer’s initial trajectory before they shut Dame down.

It is paramount that Dame not only suit up for the Raptors but also decide to stay with them. Otherwise, Toronto would have lost 3 FRP (including OG’s expiring trade value) + a youth for a few month’s rental of Dame Lillard. Dame’s value will tank even further if he asks out again after just a few months. It’s a huge risk Toronto is undertaking

Let’s focus then on why this is a bluff. 3 FRP + 1 youth is similar to Herro (to some team for 1 FRP) + 2 picks + 1 youth. The Blazers don’t think they can flip Herro and they don’t like the Heat’s 2 picks so they’re really trying to bait the Raptors into agreeing with this deal. 

If the Raptors fall for it, it’s a safe gamble for Riley to expect Dame to ask out again sooner rather than later.

If the Raptors don’t fall for it, the Heat’s offer remain the only one.

Pat Riley and the FO are right for waiting this out. This is a weak ploy by Cronin and shame on Masai for even entertaining it."
97,Did Everyone Forget We Have Dru Smith Coming Back Next Year? Championship DNA,Forget Mitchell. Let Pat Riley cook 😂 
98,Thoughts on Jimmy Butler and the upcoming 2024-25 season,"Father time destroys us all, and it is certain that this Butler-led Miami Heat team will be washed away by the inevitability of age. The question, then, must be can Jimmy summon from the very deepest crevices of his psyche the utter grit to charge the gates of basketball heaven one more time? 

Butler will be 35 heading into the start of the season, and he has not signed to the Miami Heat beyond it. He has been right on the precipice of reaching the championship many times before, and one wonders how difficult it is for Jimmy to find the strength to keep fighting against increasingly unlikely odds. 

The 2024 champions, the Boston Celtics, Butler's main rival during his tenure here, are better than ever. The Bucks, who stole the superstar who seemed destined to put Miami over the hump, loom dangerously, and the Heat's other major competitors in the East, the Sixers and the Knicks, have become much more formidable with the addition of Paul George and Mikal Bridges respectively.

The roster has never quite clicked, with Herro, Rozier and Duncan Robinson all shuffling for the 2-guard slot. Pat Riley, who has a knack for signing star players, has been unable to land any big fish; the aforementioned Lillard, of course, but none of Mitchell, Irving or Durant have made their way to Miami, any of which would have resolved the Heat's biggest problem: scoring. 

The organisation is probably going to fumble one of or both of Haywood Highsmith and Caleb Martin, two massive contributors in the recent playoff success. Hell, the reason Miami would fall short this season could be something is boring as a sprained ankle or a broken finger to Adebayo, who the Heat are lost without. 

The odds are very much not in Miami's favour, and the Cinderella run is very unlikely to happen again. But Jimmy's temperament, as you all know well, is not one typical of going quietly into that good night. No matter how it ends this year, Butler will be there, trying to will the Heat over the line. We all know, that with him on our side, we can dare to dream."
99,What does a Jimmy Butler trade look like and what could we get back?,"I do not want to trade Jimmy, I want him to win a championship with this franchise.

But I also believe that Jimmy deserves a championship and Pat Riley made a point that the core may have taken us to their ceiling. So we might be reaching a point with Jimmy in South Beach.

Realistically we don’t have enough assets if we don’t want to sacrifice Jaimie or Bam (and realistically can’t) to upgrade the roster enough.

If Jimmy asks out of  the Heat what teams are viable trade partners and what can we expect back. He likely has another 2-3 years of a championship window.

Teams that likely have assets and would be interested in my opinion are:

-Kings
-Nuggets
-OKC
-Knicks
-Golden State
-Cleveland"

I know this is from a rival GM, but it does apply to us. We're a tax team that's very close to the 2nd apron. This makes trading really difficult unless Andy Elisburg does some wizardry moving salary around.

# TRADE #1 -> Same name, Different Kyle

https://preview.redd.it/chn6jz19x3ec1.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=734c16255ec98d91b920e6bc4cdc16d34a1e7991

Kyle Kuzma said this in 2021 Media Day - “For me, wanting to get traded, and be in a type of situation where I can really spread my wings and develop a certain type of trajectory that I was on prior.”

&#x200B;

While Kyle Kuzma has upped his scoring average every year with the Wizards, it has not produced results on the win column. Now in year 3, they have missed the playoffs twice with a record of 35-47 in both years and are on pace to finish with an even worse record this season with their team currently 7-35. It's time for the Wizards to re-evaluate their future as they both have Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma for the next 4 years and for Kyle Kuzma to look at himself in the mirror if he wants to play for something bigger.

&#x200B;

For the Wizards, the reported asking price was 2 1st rounders for Kyle Kuzma so I included Nikola Jovic. We can offer pick swaps but that won't give them a higher pick. Kyle Lowry's expiring contract is the real package and they can save more money if and when they buy him out.

&#x200B;

For the Heat, it lands them Kyle Kuzma giving them a scorer that isn't shy to let it fly and his contract value decreases each year and Delon Wright another defensive player that could take on Dru Smith's role.

&#x200B;

The real question is - Are Tyler Herro and Kyle Kuzma professional enough to get behind the Katya-Elise Henry thing? Or was that always a non-story?

&#x200B;

# TRADE #2 ->  Joe Cronin and Andy Elisburg finally reach to a deal

https://preview.redd.it/fgg7cghoe4ec1.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=73324dcfa9a64ac6bc5a9e8a3ab07c567781d307

If the Trail Blazers make a trade at the deadline, executives believe Malcolm Brogdon is more likely to be traded than Jerami Grant because ""he's considered less expensive to acquire,"" per HoopsHype's Michael Scotto.

""Rival executives who spoke with HoopsHype believe a fair asking price for Brogdon is a first-round pick and salary filler,"" Scotto wrote.

&#x200B;

It's not the deal most Heat fans and rival circles were expecting between the two sides but might be significant enough to help the Heat right now. Maybe this move helps the team win comfortably rather than down and dirty in the mud or hard as cement as Coach Spoelstra mentions.

Both Malcolm Brogdon and Robert Williams III were received by the Blazers in the Jrue Holiday trade. After losing Robert Williams III for the season due to injury, I'm inclined to believe there is a shift on the Blazers plans on holding unto Malcolm Brogdon beyond this season and are trying to move him now before the trade deadline while he still has value. The 2019 1st they'll be receiving is still so far down the road but their picks (2019 own, MIL, BOS) might just come in handy once Scoot Henderson, Toumani Camara and other players hit their primes. The Blazers trade away Moses Brown who is currently injured and expendable with the emergence of Duop Reath.

Whether the deal needs to include Nikola Jovic or not, the Heat should move now if they are still operating with Jimmy Butler's timeline.

# TRADE #3 -> The Raptors-Kyle Lowry connection runs deep

https://preview.redd.it/n7xs3osau4ec1.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=026a907941dba9965ea493565436bc9c3c94db53

With the Raptors trading Pascal Siakam, it's clear that the Raptors are welcoming a new era. Immanuel Quickley has taken the helm and has been named the starting PG ever since his arrival and the Raptors might not be done making moves.

&#x200B;

Dennis Schroder was reportedly ""not happy"" with the decision to bring him off the bench, sources told Michael Grange of Sportsnet. Schroder signed with the Raptors in free agency last summer with the idea of running his own team after coming off the bench with the Lakers and Celtics in previous seasons.

&#x200B;

Although the Raptors will be acquiring Kyle Lowry, they won't be inquiring for his services. The Raptors  are currently 12th in the East and own their pick for now according to Tankathon. If their pick falls out of the top 6, their pick goes is headed to the Spurs. Expect the Raptors to be sellers and should not be expected to win games soon. They could look into what they have with Jovic and get a 1st out of it for the salary relief they provided to the Heat.

&#x200B;

The Heat get Dennis Schroder who is a pesky defender and playmaker. The rim pressure should be better as he attempted 112 shots in the restricted area and 83 in the paint (non-restricted). He's also shooting 58% in shots less than 5ft. He's also shooting 36% from three which is league average attempting most of his shots from above the break."
107,"The Blazers never re-engaged the Heat before accepting this offer from the Bucks, according to a league source. Not that the Blazers had to do this, but it's worth noting. The Heat learned of the trade when the news broke.",
