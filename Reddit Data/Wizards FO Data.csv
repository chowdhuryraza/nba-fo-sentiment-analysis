Since then, the Wizards are:

* 28th in offense, just ahead of the injury-ridden Grizzlies and Hornets.

* 23rd in defense.

* 29th in net rating, slightly ahead of the Sixers, who are missing Embiid.

* 2-13 over the last 15 games, the worst in the NBA during that time. The Pistons are about to surpass us in wins for the season.

* On a 12 game losing streak, the current longest in the NBA.

The Wizards are arguably worse now than they've been all season, with a worse net rating than the -9.0 they had under Unseld in 2023-24."
5,Wizards 2023-2024 Preview,"‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîOffseason Recap‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

On April 19, 2023, Wizards owner Ted Leonsis dismissed General Manager Tommy Shepard, signaling a new direction for the team which missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Shepard‚Äôs tenure had been tied to building around Bradley Beal and was ultimately doomed by mediocre to poor draft results and Beal himself not being an All-NBA caliber player capable of carrying a team to the playoffs.

New Wizards leadership Michael Winger and Will Dawkins major moves consisted of sending out Beal and Kristaps Porzingis while bringing in Jordan Poole, a host of veteran role players, and a haul (though not a great one) of draft assets. The Wizards also re-signed Kyle Kuzma on a team friendly deal and drafted Bilal Coulibaly.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîNew Direction‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

While the new front office‚Äôs overall plan to tear down and rebuild appears clear, the exact nature of the rebuild remains somewhat of a mystery. Whether or not you want to believe the statements of the new front office is up to you, but Winger has said he doesn‚Äôt expect this team to bottom out. Dawkins has similarly indicated that year one will be about building a culture. These statements would seem to indicate that they aren‚Äôt necessarily going to rush to trade away their key players for picks right away.

One major consideration is that the Wizards owe a top 12 protected pick to the Knicks. Though I don‚Äôt think there is a significant chance of the team being this good, if the Wizards are somehow in the play-in mix at the trade deadline, they might be incentivized to trade away their top performers to avoid sending their 2024 first round pick to the Knicks. On the other hand, they may not mind their pick conveying in a weaker draft, as the pick becomes top 10 protected in 2025 and top 8 protected in 2026. The logic here (agree or disagree) is that losing pick 9 in 2026 would be worse than pick 13 in 2024.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThis Season‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This season, I expect the Wizards to be as competitive as they are able to be while mandating playing time for guys like rookie Bilal Coulibaly and second year player Johnny Davis. The big question is: which players (if any) are traded? My prediction is they trade Landry Shamet and Danilo Gallinari to open up playing time for Johnny Davis and Bilal Coulibaly down the stretch. I think Kuzma, Poole, Jones, Deni, Kispert and Gafford all stick around the whole season to help establish a culture. I‚Äôm betting the over on 24.5 wins, but towards the end of the season, I think the front office prioritizes youth player development and misses the play-in while securing top 5 lottery odds.

A secondary goal of this season is likely to evaluate Wes Unseld Jr. as a coach. Winger has stated in an interview that Unseld Jr. being the team‚Äôs incumbent Head Coach was one of the reasons he was attracted to the job. Winger thought highly of Unseld Jr. after interviewing him for the Clippers Head Coach job, which ultimately went to Ty Lue. However, his tenure as Wizards Head Coach thus far has yielded mediocre results at best.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîLong Term‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The long term goal is, undoubtedly, to acquire a superstar who can be the best player on a championship team. While I don‚Äôt think it happens this year, at some point over the next three years, the remaining veteran players like Kuzma, Tyus Jones, Delon Wright and even Jordan Poole probably get moved. Meanwhile players like Avdija, Kispert, Davis, Gafford and Coulibaly probably form the new veteran core to pass along the team culture to whoever the front office drafts to be their next superstar, or if we‚Äôre lucky enough superstars. From there, the game becomes building around the particular skillset of the superstar(s)."
6,The Best Wizards Moments from Last Year?,"Hey, everybody. I'm trying to put together a pre-season guide for my friends who are trying to get into the NBA, and for part of it, I want to point them to 3-5 clips of the best moments each team enjoyed last season. Although most of the clips will probably be action from on the court, they don't all have to be (for example, I might do Embiid hearing he won MVP surrounded by his teammates as one for Philly, Jokic saying ""I want to stay on f\*\*\*\*\*\* parade"" at the championship parade for Denver, etc.). I figured I'd put it to each fanbase to guide me in the right direction. Any help I can get is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
7,The Will Dawkins era so far,"Kicks ass. Well at least relative to what we‚Äôve gotten used to in DC, it feels great to have a direction. It is important to remind myself this is going to take years to come together, but it‚Äôs hard not to be excited. This is the rebuild we‚Äôve been hoping for ever since the John Wall Marcheesy Gorteesy power duo split up. 

The idea seems to be prioritizing young players (duh) with great size, feel, and defensive upside. This is a very welcome departure from lineups running 3 Raul Netos at a time. Bilal, Sarr, Bub, and Kyshawn George all fit that mold, and all bring legitimate basketball skills as well.

The roster needs to be torn down even further, and I believe the new front office has shown the willingness to do that. Trading Deni was a little emotional for us, but practically it was a great move for all sides. We are not going to be good through the contracts of Deni, Kuzma, and whatever Corey signs next so it‚Äôd be best for all parties if we are able to trade those other two for picks as well (hopefully picking up one more 2025 FRP somewhere in there).

I‚Äôm excited about the players we drafted, but initially I had a lot of concern with how we could develop Sarr. It would feel pretty classic Wizards to draft the top guy in the class, who wants to be here, and completely fumble his development. I think it really does a disservice to the player and stunts their growth when the idea is ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a good 4, but in time he can put on weight and bE a CeNtEr‚Äù. If he‚Äôs a good 4, let the man play the 4 and occasionally go to the 5 while his body is built this way. If he grows into a more pure modern 5, great. It‚Äôs crucial to remember these are young guys still growing and developing their coordination and agility. The right approach to take is to let Sarr get as much practice and reps working on his movement, defense, and perimeter skills as possible. The wrong approach with guys built like him is to force him to play the 5 almost exclusively right away, which could‚Äôve happened out of necessity. I would‚Äôve hated seeing the first 2-3 years of his development wasted smoking layups in traffic and getting beat up by Embiid. Thats not good for physical or mental development, and feels like how we‚Äôve seen so many players with potential bust in the past. This is why signing Vananciunas was the absolute perfect move, and not something I think we would‚Äôve done in the past. We now have the ability to allow Sarr to develop naturally as an all around player, because there isn‚Äôt a necessity for him to fill minutes at the 5. This could be tinted by the fact that I see Sarr as developing (best case) into a player like Evan Mobley. I loved how the Cavs put him next to Allen, letting Mobley play his game and developing into a big, athletic, mobile defensive MENACE that is not ball dominant. And as a result, now when Mobley plays the 5 he‚Äôs phenomenal because he was able to develop his skill, coordination, and feel early and didn‚Äôt have to struggle as a skinny 20 year old 210lb center for most of his minutes. Sarr needs work on his shot IQ and his shot in general, let‚Äôs let him get those reps in for the first few years while we‚Äôre still not exactly winning the finals. When it‚Äôs time to compete, he‚Äôll be a better player for it and who knows who will be playing which positions for us at that point.

I‚Äôm fired up, thank you for your time."

29,Dawkins Draft Appreciation Post,"I've been looking into team rebuilds around the league recently and have noticed some similarities here and there. I think it's interesting how Dawkins has chosen to rebuild the team so far.

Most teams approach rebuilding in 1 of 2 ways.

1) A team will start their rebuild by acquiring a promising guard via trade or the draft. The next steps are typically acquiring a wing, and then ending the rebuild with a big. Sometimes a team may replace the original guard they got if a more promising one is available. See below for examples:

**Cavs:** Collin Sexton (2018), Darius Garland (2019), Isaac Okoro (2020), Evan Mobley (2021)

**Hawks:** Trae Young (2018), De'Andre Hunter (2019), Onyeka Okongwu (2020)

**OKC:** SGA (2019), Aleksej Pokusevski (2020), Josh Giddey (2021), Jalen Williams (2022), Chet Holmgren (2022)

**Magic:** Markelle Fultz (2019), Jalen Suggs (2021), Franz Wagner (2021), Paolo Banchero (2022)

**Bulls:** Josh Giddey (2024), Matas Buzelis (2024)

2) The Team will choose to draft a promising wing player and place a higher value on filling out the roster via trades/free agency rather than the draft. Examples include:

**Mavs:** Luka Doncic (2018)

**Raptors:** Scottie Barnes (2021)

What I think is really interesting with Dawkins approach is that he has used strategy 1 in succession. 

2023: Traded for Poole, drafted Bilal, and Tristan.

2024: Drafted Bub, Kyshawn, and Sarr

Most teams take 2-5 years to acquire the amount of talent that Dawkins did in 1 year, and Dawkins has done it in back to back years. He has truly done an incredible job with maximizing the amount of young talent on this roster. I'm really looking forward to what this roster looks like in 3 years when we start competing in the playoffs."
30,Went to the first 3 days of Vegas SL and watched Hawks + Rockets games live. Here're my initial observations and thoughts on the SL Wizards squad üìù,"I'll start with what y'all probably didn't/couldn't see on TV:

* **Justin Champagnie TORE INTO** the young guys (Sarr/George) during the huddle at 2:58 mark in the 4th during the Rockets game
   * [***This was after a very sloppy sequence*** ](https://x.com/_nickvillalobos/status/1812807893399322987)where Kyshawn turned the ball over, Sarr eventually got the loose ball but took an ill-advised triple, missed, and Whitmore had a dunk on the other end.
   * I thought this was very important to note because it's a testament to how young and inexperienced our boys are. It‚Äôs a process with them and patience is gonna be very important.¬†It's gonna take years for them to reach their potential and there‚Äôs gonna be many bumps and setbacks along the way.
* [**Justin was easily the best player on our SL team**](https://x.com/youngwizzyDFS/status/1811954508957667452). I loved the way he carried himself, he was very poised on the court and very clearly a well-respected veteran voice on the squad. [***Would love him on the roster.***](https://x.com/GregFinberg/status/1812628910707753449) The Wizards have done a great job with their G League/Go Go program.

Okay now the stuff you probably already saw on TV but ima share my thoughts anyway lol:

* **Wizards vs. Hawks**
   * ***Alex Sarr***
      * Slow start, literally. Seemed a step slow on the defensive end. Had some wild shot-blocking attempts early on which got him 2-3 quick fouls. Seemed to settle in much better after [***that 3-block sequence***](https://x.com/DuvaltoDMV/status/1811948161079886196).¬†
      * He is not physically imposing. Opposing teams will make sure he touches the paint as little as possible on offense, and he doesn‚Äôt really have the strength to do anything about that.¬†
      * He‚Äôs not aggressive getting his own shot/buckets on offense, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll develop into a No. 1 option. As a big who‚Äôll handle the ball a lot, he‚Äôs gotta take better care of it.¬†
      * Good: He doesn‚Äôt need to be a No. 1 scoring option for us (that‚Äôs for 2025). I think he‚Äôll serve well as a secondary playmaker out of the post. All the talk about his skills as a 7-footer is correct. I love his passing already and he‚Äôs clearly comfortable with the ball in his hands. His shooting form looks good too, especially from the line. I believe in his stretch potential. **HE LOVES A JAB STEP** üòÇ and it's actually pretty effective. He dropped a defender with one earlier in the game [***then hit this triple after a jab***](https://x.com/GregFinberg/status/1811956889644581105). Looks like his go-to.
      * Great: Legit rim protector. He has legit unicorn athleticism and will for sure be a threat in transition, both as an initiator and finisher.
   * ***Bub Carrington***
      * He‚Äôs going to be a fan favorite. Bucket-getter, athletic, great energy. His debut stat line speaks for itself. Likes going at his defender, good vision with his passes, fantastic effort on the boards. He looked real good at PG and I‚Äôm looking forward to his development.¬†
      * For the most part, he took care of the ball but had bad b2b turnovers halfway through the 4th that can‚Äôt be ignored.
      * +16 and it showed. Offense looked great when he was on the court.
      * **He is 18 years old. Will Dawkins cooked here.**
   * ***Kyshawn George***
      * I like his size (‚è∏Ô∏è), if he can put on some muscle I like his potential as a physical 3&D piece for us.¬†
      * Has a nice passing eye so another potential secondary playmaker for us from the wing spot.
      * Still a shooter at heart tho and his form looks good. Just don‚Äôt see much in terms of creating separation for his own shot.
      * Finished a passing sequence that went Bub->Sarr->Bub->George corner 3. Great to see in person.
* **Wizards vs. Rockets**
   * Yikes lmao
   * **Sarr**
      * Way more comfortable in the midrange area, has a nice lil mid-post game. Shots and everything look much better from there despite the poor shooting night. He just left everything short this game. Def doesn‚Äôt have the strength to be down in the low post often.
      * Not as comfortable from deep but like that he's still taking those shots.
      * Had a really bad game overall
   * **Vukcevic**
      * Bro got a very long ways to go on defense. On his 1st defensive possession, didn't defend the screen well at all and just watched the ball-handler take the open lane to a free layup. Didn't look interested in being good defender this game, at all.¬†
      * Don‚Äôt love his energy. Missed a wide-open oop finish and barely made it back past the half court line before the Rockets scored off his miss.
      * He's nowhere near good enough on offense for his defense & energy to be that bad.
   * **George**
      * They tried him as a primary ball-handler for a few possessions in the first half which I was happy about cause I want them to tap into any potential as a playmaker. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt go well, at all. A lot of sloppy dribbling and passing TOs (6 total).
      * Great shooter, looks very comfortable pulling up from deep (75% this game) especially off the catch.
   * **Bub**
      * Aggressive. LOVE how he attacks the boards, gets paint penetration and pulls up with confidence
      * All of that is going to lead to some sloppy TOs and bad shots. There will be growing pains with him. Didn‚Äôt like his shot selection today and was very inefficient despite the high-scoring effort.
      * That being said I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be one to shoot us out of games. He still looks to play-make and get his teammates some looks.¬†"
31,a deep dive on the wizards front office‚Äôs draft tendencies,"What is the best predictor of future success? Past performance. For example, every mock draft has the Wizards taking Rissacher at 2. If you look to the wizards past, it makes sense. The team lacks shooting, Ted is infatuated with international prospects, and the last time we picked this high we took the safe, goofy looking 3&D prospect.

However, what all those mocks forget is that we no longer have a bumbling used car salesman pretending to be an NBA GM calling the shots. Teddy Westside finally decided to bring some adults (Winger, Dawkins, and former ATL GM Travis Schlenk) into the room. Hopefully on draft night they push Ted out and lock the door.

With such an uncertain draft, I decided to take a deep dive into the draft histories of our new triumvirate. Winger started as the Clippers‚Äôs GM in 2017, as did Schlenk in ATL. Dawkins became the VP of basketball ops in OKC in 2020. In the case of  Winger and Dawkins, they weren‚Äôt the final decision makers, but they were key decision makers on all of these picks. 

My goal is to hopefully deduce some form of preference in scouting. These preferences could range from body type, play style, team building philosophy, age, etc. 

Between the three of them they‚Äôve made 16 top 20 picks between 2017-2022. Most are by Schlenk (8), followed by Dawkins (6), and Winger (2, both in 2017). I‚Äôve organized the prospects by position into the following categories: Small Guards, Big Guards, Wings with Guard Skills, Pure Wings, Big Wings, Pure Forwards, Combo Bigs, and Pure Bigs. I‚Äôve listed the team, draft position and draft year next to each prospect. Try not to nitpick where I have these guys listed too much. 

**Small Guards**
(sub 6‚Äô4 barefoot, capable of running an offense)

2018 - Trae Young - 5th- ATL

2018 - Jerome Robinson - 13th - LAC

2021 - Tre Mann - 18th - OKC

**Big Guards**
(taller than 6‚Äô4 barefoot, capable of running an offense)

2018 - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - 11th - LAC

**Wings with Guard Skills**
(6‚Äô5-6‚Äô9 barefoot, capable of shot creation for themselves and others)

2021 - Josh Giddey - 6th - OKC

2022 - Jalen Williams - 12th - OKC

**Pure Wings**
(6‚Äô5-6‚Äô9 barefoot, primarily off ball, limited on ball players) 

2018 - Kevin Huerter - 19 - ATL

2019 - Reddish - 10 - ATL

2022 - AJ Griffin - 16 - ATL

**Big Wings**
(6‚Äô7-6‚Äô10 barefoot, skilled enough to play on the perimeter but strong enough to switch into bigs)

2019- Deandre Hunter - ATL

**Pure Forwards**
(6‚Äô8-7‚Äô0 barefoot, perimeter skills in a bigger body, can‚Äôt reliably defend the rim/defend the post/rebound)

2017 - John Collins - 17 - ATL

2020 - Aleksej Pokusevski - 17 - OKC

2022 - Ousmane Dieng - OKC

**Combo Bigs**
(6‚Äô8-7‚Äô0+ barefoot, perimeter skills in a big man‚Äôs body, can reliably defend the rim/defend the post/rebound) 

2021- Jalen Johnson - 20 - ATL

2022 - Chet Holmgren - 2 - OKC

**Pure Big**
(6‚Äô8-7‚Äô0+ barefoot, can protect the rim, rebound, and defend the post, lacking in perimeter skills)

2020 - Onyeka Okongwu - 6 - ATL

**Analysis**
 
1. Personally shocked by how many small guards ended up on this list. The way people talk about these teams made me think they didn‚Äôt draft anyone south of 6‚Äô6. In fact it seems that Schlenk doesn‚Äôt value positional size much at all outside of Hunter. 

2. None of these guys value traditional big man.

3. Schlenk values shooting 

4. Dawkins puts high stock on putting the ball on the floor

**How this relates to the 2024 Draft**

Sarr is guaranteed to be number 1 on their board. Someone that big, who moves that fluidly, and likes to put the ball on the floor is definitely the type of player Winger and Dawkins like. The profile isn‚Äôt even too dissimilar from John Collins, so Schlenk is probably on board too. On the flip, scrap Clingan from the big board. If he can‚Äôt put the ball on the floor, these guys don‚Äôt want him. Sorry David Aldridge.

But we all pretty much knew that already. What we didn‚Äôt know is how much all of these guys value having a lead initiator. All these guys like starting a rebuild with a lead guard, star upside type. In 2018, Schlenk and Winger took the plunge on Young and SGA (the Clips were in a brief rebuilding phase at the time). After OKC traded for SGA, they used their first high lottery pick on another big guard-ish player in Giddey (to less than stellar returns). 

The only big guard at the top is Topic, so I would have him at the top of the Wiz‚Äôs board as well, tho his injuries make him an unlikely pick. However, as mentioned before, each one of these guys took a small guard before, 2 in the lottery. Sheppard still profiles as too off ball for their liking, but Dillingham is a much more attractive pick through this lens. 

As far as the wings they‚Äôve shown interest in, Rissacher doesn‚Äôt really resemble any of them. Only perhaps Deandre Hunter, who was older, and more resembled what we‚Äôd hope Rissacher would be in 2 years. Wingkins (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling them now) don‚Äôt care if you are a good shooter, they think they can teach it to you. They want shot creators who put stress on the defense.

Wings who fit that category are guys like Holland and Buzelis. Hardworking long athletes who attack off the catch that need seasoning. Castle could also fit here maybe, but he‚Äôs a worse athlete with less creation flashes. 

I‚Äôd bet if Sarr is there, he‚Äôs the pick. If he‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs Topic. If they don‚Äôt like Topic‚Äôs medicals, then it will be one of Holland, Buzelis, or Dillingham, with the decision based off their individual workouts and interviews. 

What do you guys think?
"
32,Where do we go from here Wiz loyal wiz fans,"We brought in a seemingly more qualified GM in Will Dawkins. If there‚Äôs anything about his history at OKC it‚Äôs that they know how to tank and rebuild/acquire picks. This year‚Äôs draft is kinda garbage for tanking, but Collier might be a decent start to get our pg of the future at least. Unfortunately the true tank is gonna start for Cooper Flagg the year after and my only goal for this year is we get a first outta Kuz, get something out of Danilo and Poole even though he‚Äôs been beyond ass. Wes is seemingly the tank commander but clearly we‚Äôre gonna need a new coach too in the off-season. It‚Äôs hard being a wiz fan atm maybe just sign John Wall to give me something to watch at least/ our best distributor is Kuz atm."
33,Brian Keefe's first 15 games as head coach,"Will Dawkins and Michael Winger made the decision to fire Wes Unseld Jr. because they were not satisfied with the level of competition being displayed in games.

Since then, the Wizards are:

* 28th in offense, just ahead of the injury-ridden Grizzlies and Hornets.

* 23rd in defense.

* 29th in net rating, slightly ahead of the Sixers, who are missing Embiid.

* 2-13 over the last 15 games, the worst in the NBA during that time. The Pistons are about to surpass us in wins for the season.

* On a 12 game losing streak, the current longest in the NBA.

The Wizards are arguably worse now than they've been all season, with a worse net rating than the -9.0 they had under Unseld in 2023-24."

35,Some thoughts on Tanking ,"First I‚Äôll start by saying I 100 percent was and am supportive of the tear down of the roster to the ground floor, my only issue is that we should‚Äôve done it probably 3-4 years earlier when we had the ability to get some better assets. 

Second, I see a lot of posts that have quickly turned from embracing the rebuild to shaming the talent on the roster, or lack thereof. The rebuild to me isn‚Äôt just about losing and getting a better lotto pick, any team could do that if that were the recipe to success. The important part will start soon when we see how the Winger/Dawkins duo does with using the picks to correctly evaluate talent in the draft. That can be done without getting the number 1 lotto ball every year. 

Finally, I think the most important part of our process is what happens mid rebuild. Once we have some good pieces we have to be careful not to push to contend immediately with them by selling off future assets. Remember we are basically in year zero of this process and thinking it can happen overnight is what got us in this spot to begin with.

An Optimistic Wizards fan "
36,The smartest thing the new front office has done is descending contracts,"This offseason, the new front office regime signed both kuz and Deni to new contracts. The initial numbers were jarring to some people, but when you break it down, these were great deals that will age like fine wine.

Here is what these guys will make over their 4 year contract:

*Kuzma ‚Äî 25.5M, 23.5M, 21.5M, 19.4M*

*Deni ‚Äî 15.6M, 14.4M, 13.1M, 11.9M*

Over that time, here is how the salary cap is projected to change:

*136M (this year), 149M, 164M, 181M, 199M*

__This means that in the final year of their deals, kuzma will take up ~11% of the cap and Deni will take up ~6%.__

The fact that their contracts decrease when 99% of contracts increase is brilliant with where we are at in our rebuild. Our cap sheet is fairly clean (*cough Jordan Poole cough*) so we can afford to pay the higher numbers now. They will be great values when we are starting to become competitive again, allowing us flexibility in making moves. And if it becomes clear that they will not be a part of the next great wizards team, their lower cap hit will make them more desirable in the trade market.

This is the sharpest thing winger + Dawkins have done for the team imo"
37,The ‚Äúfills a need‚Äù concept and why it likely doesn‚Äôt apply to the Wizards,"Dawkins & Winger aren‚Äôt drafting for immediate needs, because this team doesn‚Äôt have any from a positional standpoint. That is to say that this teams ‚Äúneeds‚Äù are to develop players for the future, not assemble a Sheppard 2.0 team that‚Äôs fighting for a play-in spot. The 2024-2025 season will be primarily focused on growing the young players already on the team, as well as whoever is drafted at 2 + 26. They‚Äôre not going to draft for position at 2, they‚Äôre going to draft for ceiling. Internal team goals for the season are likely:
‚Ä¢ Construct a starting lineup that allows for Poole to improve his shooting %
‚Ä¢ Have Kispert make an ‚ÄúAvdija-esque‚Äù jump over the course of the year by improving defense and shooting consistency 
‚Ä¢ Get Bilal a lot of minutes with the second team for the first half of the season before making him a mainstay of the starting lineup.
‚Ä¢ Give Bagley consistent floor time in first half of season to improve trade value. Let Tristan pick up the minutes post-trade.
‚Ä¢ Put the #2 pick in the least pressurized environment as possible. If the pick is Topic (as many seem to think it will be), he will be a project for sure and would not have a clear path to the starting lineup at all. My guess is that they‚Äôre are going to draft for ceiling on both picks rather than immediate impact players. That was clearly the thought process last year and nothing they‚Äôve done or said so far in the offseason would lead one to think this year would be any different. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù to trade Kuzma, but I don‚Äôt think they hesitate on pulling the trigger if the right offer comes in. 

"
38,Fire Dawkins / Fire Winger,"KP just single-handedly won a national TV game for Boston with 30 points and 4 blocks. Our GM clowns were so eager to trade him that they barely got cents on the dollar ‚Äî the return for a guy with his skill set, character, and contract was an absolute disgrace. 

Our front office thinks they get a free pass for several years ‚Äî how many years, five? ‚Äî as we intentionally tank. They‚Äôre so inept that they even kept WUJ on board and praised him! Think about that after everything we‚Äôve endured with this coach for the last three years. 

I‚Äôm absolutely sick of this and it makes me sick to watch KP ‚Äî the most talented Wizard in 15 years, who happened to be extremely high character and love this city ‚Äî ball out somewhere else when we got pennies for him.  

It‚Äôs disgraceful and they need to be held accountable. I cannot stand that our GMs think they can get a free pass for a decade as we slowly tank. It‚Äôs about job security, right? They want to continue getting paid while convincing Ted that it‚Äôs okay - we‚Äôll just suck for 5-10 years and it‚Äôs all part of the plan. By the way, keep paying us top dollar, Ted. What we‚Äôre doing is smart and analytical, and KP wasn‚Äôt even a good player. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre telling him, I‚Äôm sure. 

They should be fired today. This morning. Out the door. Winger and Dawkins are a joke to this city and watching KP contend for MVP this year will only reaffirm this. I cannot put into words the insurmountable damage and destruction they have brought to our cherish city and our Wizards team."
39,"The NBA trade deadline is next Thursday. Feels like Keefe should look to change the starting lineup, and sit guys like Kuzma, Jones & Shamet.","In their press conference the other day, Winger and Dawkins talked about how there are a ton of games left in the season to be able to see things.  

All the vets are what they are. Jones's skills are known, Kuzma's skills are evident, and what guys like Shamet can bring to the table is clear. Leading up to the trade deadline we play the Spurs, Clippers, Heat, Suns & Cavs.  

I'd love to see them sit Kuzma and company, and start a lineup like Butler, Poole (since he doesn't seem to be on the trade market), Bilal, Deni and Gafford (or Bagley).  The Suns game next Sunday is on NBATV at 3:30 pm. I know how ownership likes to put its best product on the floor for 'nationally' televised games, so sure, play the current starting lineup that game if you want. 

But really we need to go head and switch up the lineup. Livers/Bags, PBJ, Delon & Corey can come off the bench along with Gill, and let Deni finally attempt to be PG for an extended period of time.  We've moved off nearly everything and everybody that was around when we were trying to compete. Beal. WUJ. Tommy.  Maybe let Kuzma rest until a trade finalizes and do the same for Jones and Shamet so they don't get banged up and mess up what will actually be the real start of the tank, where we play our young guys and keep bringing in more young guys.  

Looks like Delon and Gill will be the OGs who are just around for the culture but not real factors, assuming nobody picks up Delon. I just think it's time to actually do something bold and decisive. Kind of drawing a line in the sand and fully end the ""Mid"" era.  If they want to let Kuzma play vs his business partner Wemby one last time, go for it.  

But after that, look at this murderer's row of opponents we face starting today, through the end of February:  

-

LA Clippers (30-14)  
Miami Heat (24-22)  
Phoenix Suns (26-19, won 8 of their last 9)  
Cleveland Cavs (27-16)  
Boston Celtics (35-11)  
Philadelphia 76ers (29-15)  
Dallas Mavericks (25-21...Luka just scored 73)  
Pelicans (26-20)  
Nuggets  
Thunder  
Cavs  
Warriors  
Lakers    

-

We're likely going to lose 13 or all 14 of these games. At least let the young guys run things for a while. It's time to start them and throw them into the fire. Johnny Davis seems to be a lost cause to them so not him, but everybody else should get chances to start against these teams.  Butler, Bilal, Corey, PBJ, Geno, Jules Bernard, Hami, JBJ.  Lets actually start this rebuild."
40,2023/24 Season Review,"The Wizards have finished their first year under a new Front Office and things have gone a lot better than anticipated from a Culture, Talent, and Asset perspective.

**Culture:**

Dawkins and Winger had a lot of work to do to change the culture of the Wizards internally and how the organization is perceived by players and agents.

This season they brought in a number of players such as Tyus Jones and Jordan Poole who needed a fresh start and a chance to prove to others what they're capable of.

* For Tyus that was proving that he could be a starting caliber PG in the NBA.
* For Poole, it was to get himself out of Golden State after the practice incident with Draymond and prove he could be a great player without Steph, Dray, Klay, and the Warriors system.

They've also given opportunities to NBA/GLeague players such as Jared Butler, Eugene Omoruye, and brought over our draft and stash prospect Tristan Vukcevic (Who was also in a tough sport with his Euro team).

They were also able to convert guys like Jules Bernard and Julian Champagnie from 10 day contracts to 2-way contracts, allowing them to spend more time with the Wizards and have the experience of being an NBA player.

All of these things, big or small, matter to these guys and help players and agents view the organization in a more positive light. Dawkins himself mentioned in his exit interview with Winger that they're starting to hear good things from agents based on what they accomplished this season.

**Talent:**

From a talent perspective, we still have a long way to go, but we have a number of players that can still grow into better players.

* Bilal Coulibaly - already a better player than most anticipated, not seeing any gleague time, and often guarding the opponents best offensive players as a rookie
* Tristan Vukcevic - Bigs who can rebound and stretch the floor are valuable even in limited minutes, interested to see what he looks like over a full season next year
* Deni Avdija - A secondary playmaker who can play either forward spot, and is an above average defender. Great shooting improvement this year, hopefully it remains consistent
* Jordan Poole - Had an incredibly tough season, but fought to find ways to contribute, even coming off the bench. I think his best days are ahead of him, and curious what he looks like as a PG full time

With a record of 15-67, Last in our conference and 2nd to last in the league, we have given ourselves the chance at a very high draft pick to continue to add talent our roster going forward.

Another thing to note is that 43 of our games were decided by 10 points or less. I think this roster is a bit more competitive than fans and other teams may give them credit for.

**Assets:**

In terms of contract/player assets the main two that we have are Tyus Jones and Kyle Kuzma, both of which are coming off some great individual performance years.

Kuzma is known as a guy who will put up shots and get points, but this year he also showed that he can be a distributor to a degree as well, averaging 4 assists per game, while also providing some rebounding at 7 a game.

Tyus was able to show why he could be a starting PG, sporting a 7:1 assist to turnover ratio, along with being a reliable floor spacer shooting 41% from 3 on 4 attempts. Not only that, but he did all this with a 16% usage%. This could indicate that he can play next to other ball dominate players and still maintain similar production next to them. The Wizards gave him a chance to shine, hopefully we work out a sign an trade with him in the off season.

TLDR:

1. We've started to become a place where players can have an opportunity to play and prove themselves. Slowly washing off the stench of mediocrity and becoming an org that can be taken seriously
2. We have some solid talent on the roster with Bilal, Tristan, Deni, and Poole. This team is more competetive than we think.
3. We have some players that hopefully can be traded for picks in Tyus and Kuzma."
41,Wizards 2023-2024 Preview,"‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîOffseason Recap‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

On April 19, 2023, Wizards owner Ted Leonsis dismissed General Manager Tommy Shepard, signaling a new direction for the team which missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Shepard‚Äôs tenure had been tied to building around Bradley Beal and was ultimately doomed by mediocre to poor draft results and Beal himself not being an All-NBA caliber player capable of carrying a team to the playoffs.

New Wizards leadership Michael Winger and Will Dawkins major moves consisted of sending out Beal and Kristaps Porzingis while bringing in Jordan Poole, a host of veteran role players, and a haul (though not a great one) of draft assets. The Wizards also re-signed Kyle Kuzma on a team friendly deal and drafted Bilal Coulibaly.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîNew Direction‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

While the new front office‚Äôs overall plan to tear down and rebuild appears clear, the exact nature of the rebuild remains somewhat of a mystery. Whether or not you want to believe the statements of the new front office is up to you, but Winger has said he doesn‚Äôt expect this team to bottom out. Dawkins has similarly indicated that year one will be about building a culture. These statements would seem to indicate that they aren‚Äôt necessarily going to rush to trade away their key players for picks right away.

One major consideration is that the Wizards owe a top 12 protected pick to the Knicks. Though I don‚Äôt think there is a significant chance of the team being this good, if the Wizards are somehow in the play-in mix at the trade deadline, they might be incentivized to trade away their top performers to avoid sending their 2024 first round pick to the Knicks. On the other hand, they may not mind their pick conveying in a weaker draft, as the pick becomes top 10 protected in 2025 and top 8 protected in 2026. The logic here (agree or disagree) is that losing pick 9 in 2026 would be worse than pick 13 in 2024.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThis Season‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This season, I expect the Wizards to be as competitive as they are able to be while mandating playing time for guys like rookie Bilal Coulibaly and second year player Johnny Davis. The big question is: which players (if any) are traded? My prediction is they trade Landry Shamet and Danilo Gallinari to open up playing time for Johnny Davis and Bilal Coulibaly down the stretch. I think Kuzma, Poole, Jones, Deni, Kispert and Gafford all stick around the whole season to help establish a culture. I‚Äôm betting the over on 24.5 wins, but towards the end of the season, I think the front office prioritizes youth player development and misses the play-in while securing top 5 lottery odds.

A secondary goal of this season is likely to evaluate Wes Unseld Jr. as a coach. Winger has stated in an interview that Unseld Jr. being the team‚Äôs incumbent Head Coach was one of the reasons he was attracted to the job. Winger thought highly of Unseld Jr. after interviewing him for the Clippers Head Coach job, which ultimately went to Ty Lue. However, his tenure as Wizards Head Coach thus far has yielded mediocre results at best.

‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîLong Term‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The long term goal is, undoubtedly, to acquire a superstar who can be the best player on a championship team. While I don‚Äôt think it happens this year, at some point over the next three years, the remaining veteran players like Kuzma, Tyus Jones, Delon Wright and even Jordan Poole probably get moved. Meanwhile players like Avdija, Kispert, Davis, Gafford and Coulibaly probably form the new veteran core to pass along the team culture to whoever the front office drafts to be their next superstar, or if we‚Äôre lucky enough superstars. From there, the game becomes building around the particular skillset of the superstar(s)."
42,GAME 62 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (9-53) LOSE TO THE ORLANDO MAGIC (37-26),"No shame in losing to the hottest team in the Association right now, but there is shame in blowing a 21 point lead. Here are my 5 takeaways from Wednesday's showdown in the District: 

1. The Wizards could've easily won this one. They came out firing on all cylinders in the first quarter and jumped out to an early lead. There was crazy deja vu to the game in SLC, as Poole got sizzling hot in the second quarter (again). It was eery how similar this game was to the Jazz game. In the second half, Poole cooled down again, Kuz cooled down, and our offense shut down. I don't know what it is about the last 5-6 minutes of a game, but this team can't score in the last 5-6 minutes to save their lives. It was bad iso possession after another bad iso possession. Wizards also got way too trigger happy after the first half. They stopped sticking to their strengths: driving and scoring in the paint, and started just chucking and taking bad shots. Need Keefe to drill this into the heads of everyone on this team: ATTACK THE DAMN RIM. Everyone on this team is proficient at attacking the rim and they need to play into that strength. 
2. The Kuzma Poole duo had nice games. 25 points, 5 boards, and 4 dimes for Kuzma on 10-19 shooting. He did well, but again he scored a chunk of his points in the first quarter, and most of them in the first half. He was totally cold in the second half and particularly in the clutch period. Same can be said for Poole. Idk what happened to Poole after he moved to the bench, but he's FINALLY playing like the player we thought we were getting from GS. No complaints better late than never I suppose. However, even he got sizzling hot in the second quarter and then couldn't hit a shot to save his life in the clutch period. I don't know if the problems in the clutch are solvable just because neither Kuz or Poole are closers. They are and always will be complementary pieces to a main piece. Asking them to act like the man will never work out well. 
3. We need to see more aggression from Coulibaly. Before the ASB he started to be more aggressive and it was clear there were some actions designed for him. Now he's just standing in the corner. I don't understand what this concept of standing in the corner is. Why do the coaches have our player that needs the ball the most just standing in the corner like he's useless? He needs to take more shots and have more designed plays for him that have him going to the rim. We know he can shoot the ball well, he needs to now work on finishing in the paint where it's clear he's still very raw. Need to get him as many reps as possible attacking the rack. 
4. Like in the past 3 times we've played the Magic this season we got TORCHED by the forward duo of the Magic in Banchero and Wagner. They both did most of their damage attacking the rack and being physical. The lack of size against the two long athletic forwards of the Magic really killed us. It was really disheartening to see how easy Banchero and Wagner manhandled our ""defenders."" Also per usual, too many times was Wagner (a knockdown shooter) left WIDE open. Just utterly unacceptable defense. Feel like the team got complacent once we raced out to a 21 point lead and just never locked back in. 
5. Okay so there's good news from all of this: At least we're competing in games now. Before we were getting blown out by like 30-45 points, and now we're at least showing we are capable of competing and keeping it close against good teams on a nightly basis. Feel like the next step is to start stealing a couple of the games in clutch time. Clutch time shot making is the next step for the development of all of our young guys be it Deni, Kispert, or Bilal. None of them are that proficient in the clutch period, and I feel like it's a good opportunity for them to learn how to do that. 

It's frustrating to see the team blow a 21 point lead, but we have to understand that our end goal is to lose this season. We achieve nothing by winning anymore. This season is a lost cause and is purely for development. As will be next season and likely the season after that. Curb you expectations to win for at least the next 2 seasons. If Winger and Dawkins are able to hit on their picks and we continue developing our younguns it's possible that by the start of 3 seasons from now we can actually place some expectations for competing much like the Magic are starting to do now, but till then it's going to be tough out here. Let's hope we can get a win tonight though so we can put an end to this losing streak. I really am not tryna break any records. "
43,GAME 67 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (11-56) LOSE TO THE CHICAGO BULLS (33-35),"No Coby? No problem for the Bulls who played like we were absolutely no problem for them. This was a blowout through and through. Couldn't even close the margin during garbage time. Just absolute dominance by the Bulls from start to finish. Here are my 5 takeaways from last night's game: 

1. This was a balanced scoring performance from our guys. Almost every starter with the exception of Richaun got into double figures scoring wise. Kispert led the scoring with 16 points on 6-12 shooting and 3-6 from deep,. Feel like Kispert needs to let it fly more mercilessly. His best skillset always has been and always will be letting that thang fly from deep and I feel like he needs to do that at least 10 times a game. Especially when his shot is on. I know he is very proficient inside the arc too, but feel like he's passing up threes a lot these days. Also shoutout to my boy getting 3 blocks and 3 steals. He gets a lot of flack for his defense, but he was definitely trying and locked in tonight. I want to see more of that, because he's clearly capable of defending at least decently if he tries and stays locked in for 48. 
2. Not a good game for Kuz. Felt like Kuz never really got it going this game. He had only 11 points, and he didn't take any 3P shots which is very very uncharacteristic for him. He just seemed passive and looked like he never mentally was checked into this one, because he usually commands the ball and we see forceful isolation plays for him. Felt like once the Bulls sucker punched us in the first quarter, him and the rest of the team just never quite recovered. 
3. We uncharacteristically shot 40%+ from the 3P line, but shot a ghastly 43% from the field and 59% from the FT line!!! That in comparison to the Bulls shooting 58% from the field was all they needed to beat the crap out of us. They shot average from everywhere else and that was good enough for them to beat the living crap out of us. The lack of any large personnel in this one made it VERY VERY easy for them to get whatever they wanted in the paint. I REALLY REALLY hope we get a big in this year's draft (fingers crossed for Sarr), because the paint has been softer than Swiss cheese since Gaff left. Been really hard to watch especially as of late. 
4. We got cooked by...checks notes.....Ayo Dosunmu.....A tale as old time, a random role player drops a season high 34 points on us. When does it stop? When will this team stop being the team where opposing players mark it on their calendars as new career/season highs? When will we stop being the team where random players have their breakout game? I'm not saying Ayo is a bad player, I actually like him quite a lot, and wouldn't mind him on the Wiz (Dawkins + Winger make it happen somehow), but it's just frustrating that everyone from Alec Burks to Troy Jameson to now Ayo Dosunmu drop highs on us of some kind. It's a tale as old as time. He really was unstoppable and was driving with determination bouncing off defenders to finish in the paint, and nailed his deep jumpers as well. Easy 34 for Ayo. 
5. Bilal had a decent game. 15 points on 5-9 shooting for the Rook. The one part of his game that has really lacked behind that has been surprising given his good three point shooting is his FT shooting. I'm guessing this is just a brute forceing sort of thing where the more he practices it and just shoots in practice he'll get better at. He clearly is a good shooter at worst, with his 3P shooting. He was 4-8 from the FT line last night. Just needs to lock himself in a gym, perfect a FT routine, and nail those things. You do not want to leave that many points at the charity stripe. This is really something that can be nailed down with a lot of practice and I think over the summer it will be something he will improve on. 

This was a bad loss, but it happens to the best of us I suppose. Keefe tried to stop the bleeding with aggressive TOs, but just wasn't meant to win in CHI town tonight. If we thought last night was bad, if we don't have Deni tonight, cover the kids' eyes for tonight. The Celtics are in prime form and are going to kick the ever living crap out of us. That box score will get ugly fast. Wouldn't blame y'all if you decided to watch some college basketball instead of the Wiz. Sigh. I'll see the rest of you sick mfers who like hurting yourself at 6 PM!"
44,GAME 29 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (5-24) LOSE TO THE ORLANDO MAGIC (18-11),"In what was an entertaining affair till the last tick, the Wizards lost a close back and forth affair with the Magic on their home court in the 202 last night. Here are my 5 takeaways from last night's game: 

1. Wizards played no defense till it was too late. Way too many open transition threes, and it didn't look like anyone had any urgency to close out on open shooters. Sorry ass excuse of a defense. We were getting cooked by mid shooters because of the fact that they were getting wide open shots. Jalen Suggs and Anthony Black cooked us from deep which is about all you need to know about the Wizards defense last night. 
2. JP had another 30 piece last night. 20 of which came in the fourth quarter. He absolutely showed out in the clutch last night, but it was too little too late. He had some crazy impressive threes and finishes inside the paint though, I will grant him that. He canned 6 triples and was 11-20 from the field overall, which was one of his better shooting performances of the season. He was on and it was fun to see last night. Even with that performance Wiz were a -18 with him on the court which should tell you what the advanced stats see when they see JP on the floor: hint: it's not good. Lack of effort on defense was a real issue, though he was shooting the gap and aggressive on defense at times. Maintaining consistency has been an issue that has plagued him not just this season but throughout his career. 
3. Tyus had 22 points and 6 assists and 6 boards last night. He was sorta on triple double watch. He was red hot in the first half and canned like 3 triples, but for some reason we didn't feature him as much as we should've and he kinda cooled down towards the latter half of the game. I love how Tyus is playing, cause that trade value keeps going up, up, and up baby!!!
4. I am loving the growth I am seeing from Gafford. He has truly taken a step forward both as a scorer and rebounder. He had 13 points and 13 boards tonight to go along with 3 blocks and 2 steals. He has been a total menace on offense and defense. He has gotten better at getting stocks and boards on defense and better at scoring on offense. I hate seeing him in trade talks though. I do not want him shipped off for a late first rounder. I want to keep him around for the rebuild. Gaff is young. He's barely 25. He can stick around 4-6 more years and be around for the full rebuild. It's hard to find multi-dimensional, athletic, young, and good spirited teammates like him. He is one of the pieces that I think reflects the culture that Winger and Dawkins want to build here. 
5. We got cooked all around by the Magic. While Paolo and Franz were the main troublemakers, almost everyone that got minutes got into double figures. When you're getting cooked by damn Mo Wagner, you got problems. Play with some damn pride like COME ON. Man just frustrating because this was a very easy game to win, but thrown because of lack of effort. It's especially scary, because you don't want that type of mentality and attitude to seep into the youngsters like Bilal and Corey and Deni who are competing and fighting hard and want to win. The vets/players who are propogating that sort of attitude need to be thrown out. 

It was overall entertaining to see Poole and the Wiz storm all the way back to bring it to within 4 with 2 minutes to go, but lack of defense screwed them over once again. Let's see what they do against another team similar to Orlando in Toronto tonight. I'll be there, so let's hope the boys put on a good show for me! I'll see y'all after the game!"
