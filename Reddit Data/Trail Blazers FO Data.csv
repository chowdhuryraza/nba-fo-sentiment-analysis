We cashed in for max value and got ourselves a really exciting young core in Scoot/Ant/Shae/Toumani/Bari/DA. Also pieces to flip in Grant Brogdon and Timelord (although I‚Äôm not sure his stock is anything at all now). And the bucks will SUCK when we‚Äôre coming good. Viva la blazers"

10,Mike Richman tiers his list of blame for this season. At the top of the list is Joe Cronin.,"1. Cronin - he states that Cronin has built bad rosters ever since his hiring and the onus for this season predominantly falls on him and the talent he has put together in this roster

2. Billups - he believes Billups has not been a good coach

3. Ownership* - he doesn‚Äôt necessarily see ownership group as a problem but faults them for not making changes either to the coaching staff or front office

4. Bad luck - we were stuck with bad injury luck throughout this season

Can find the podcast here: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0LOX3EAq6Wb6T3glojJuty?si=sgXvT0F6QzWtzkPkxQQ92Q&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A5JX8iraZGkszb5tsPQNsMU

I think both the front office and coaching staff needs to be completely overhauled. This is a results based league and neither Cronin nor Billups have put together a winning team.

18,Dear Joe Cronin -,"Quit going backwards. Right now you have a solid team. Ant should be the leader on the court but he‚Äôs not reaching for it or is it the lack of support from coaching or management to build him up? Your scoring rotation if everyone is healthy should be Ant,, D‚ÄôAndre/Grant, Shae, Scoot.

Regarding coaching, Billups is a great guy but he‚Äôs not our right guy. So Billups needs to change his tune / philosophy or go coach somewhere else.  Bring back Monty who got the best out of D‚ÄôAndre in Phx. we could have one of the top 3 front courts if Clingan and Ayton had the right coach.

Don‚Äôt shop Ant unless you get a no conditional 1st"

21,"""Our goal was to get way more athletic, be more physically capable, better defensively, a team that‚Äôs gonna play really fast and up-tempo and share the ball and trust each other and play together and stay connected ‚Äî the brand of basketball [Head Coach Chauncey Billups] wants to play."" - Joe Cronin","Let it be known, this style of play ***was not*** possible to achieve with Dame on this roster. Dame refuses to play up-tempo basketball with lots of ball movement. He is a slow-paced, PnR scoring guard and that is how his teams will play. Chauncey came in wanting to play as described above but never even got the chance with Dame vetoing that real quick. 

&#x200B;

I am so excited to see what Chauncey can do without Dame here. I am stoked to finally see an up tempo Blazers team with hyper athletes all over the floor. I am excited to have a true PG with elite passing ability who doesn't need to score to have an impact. A PG that elevates his teammates and seeks them out. A PG who wants to push the pace. This is gonna be real fun! "

I love Dame, but the way they were trying to bully us through the media to just go along with their plan was crazy!

A lesser GM would have acquiesced and taken the lesser deal instead of doing what was best for the team. It takes some real balls for a 2nd year GM to ignore a trade destination like that. It feels like we kept our dignity as a franchise.

Let the Scoot era begin üöÄ"

28,Joe Cronin has created an arms race in the Eastern Conference,"Dame on the Bucks makes them the favorites, and now Joe possess the best anti-Dame defender that he can flip to Boston or Philly or Miami.

29,Joe cronin appreciation post,"Joe got so much hate for not trading the 3rd pick and a lot of other things before that for a superstar to pair with dame here in portland, even though the best we could of gotten was Jimmy Butler or some player about to leave their prime. I feel like we all hated him to a degree, but this trade was an absolute W. Not only did we get a perfect fit with our young core, we basically made sure no other team could have Giannis, which the heat were saving up for (and it feels good that they took a huge L). It wasn‚Äôt the best possible trade value wise, but it‚Äôs a great fit. i‚Äôm expecting us to be a play in team if we stay healthy!!"

37,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with saying we need to be patient with Scoot‚Ä¶.while also acknowledging he isn‚Äôt nearly as NBA ready as he was hyped to be,I find myself holding my breath sometimes when he has the ball. So many wild decisions üòÇ
38,Anfernee and #5 for #1 overall?,"body text. If Portland can‚Äôt find a Wemby/Giannis/Jokic stopper, what is the point of having high draft picks? The next five to seven years will become very bleak if we can‚Äôt get a ‚ÄúJonathon Isaac‚Äù type defender or generational big to compete against high level competition. It‚Äôs a copycat league, and the generational big-man era is in full swing. I don‚Äôt know if Sarr is the guy, but he sure looks great against lower levels of competition. 

Sorry this doesn‚Äôt have any analytics, but if that offer isn‚Äôt good enough what would you offer? It‚Äôs about time for Joe Cronin to push the chips to the middle of the table and go all in. If not, he‚Äôs exactly who they keep telling us he is."
39,What,
40,This is the perfect draft to evaluate the front office,"This is perfect situation to see what Mike Schmitz and Joe Cronin can do with the most muddy draft we‚Äôve had in a while. Last year was more or less a consensus pick of Scoot, but the outcome was a little underwhelming.

With no absolute standouts in this draft and the possibility of player 15 being as good as player 1 and no pressure on picking what might be viewed as an outlier. This is the perfect draft to see where the front office stands. "

42,"not 100% sure if drafting Donovan Clingan means a new era for Blazers bigs entirely, but one thing is pretty clear",
43,At what point does Cronin deserve to be on the chopping block?,"Okay first and foremost let's talk about how he got the job:

Before being GM Cronin was an understudy of Olshey. Per his own bio on NBA.com:

>In 2010 he was promoted to Pro Scout/Salary Cap Analyst where he was a crucial part of the player evaluation and **roster construction process**. In 2014, he was named the team‚Äôs Director of Player Personnel and **was active in the NBA Draft, trades, and free agent acquisitions and negotiations**. in 2021, Cronin was named Assistant General Manager where he managed the team‚Äôs Salary Cap and oversaw its amateur and professional scouting.

As he was the director of player personnel and assistant GM during between 2014-2021, two very important positions in a front office, he was one of the core causes of the 'Oops all guards' rosters at the end of Dame's time in PDX. 

In Dec. 2021, Olshey deservedly got fired and he was promoted to interim GM. 

Later that season, he was promoted to GM with zero experience in the job and **without facing any competition for the job.** Why? I don't think anyone knows for sure, but it's probably because Jody and Bert Kolde wanted to save a bit of money and not pay for an experienced GM. 

Let's talk about his trades after Olshey to ""restructure"" the team:


**Move 1:** 

Traded Robert Covington and Norman Powell to the Los Angeles Clippers for Eric Bledsoe, Keon Johnson, Justise Winslow and a 2025 2nd round draft pick. We also received a trade exception.

This trade in hindsight looks terrible. None of the players we received are on the team currently and outside of Keon Johnson, none of the players we received are in the NBA. This deal was not a good deal. We gave away Norm (A 6th man of the year candidate this year) for basically nothing.  


**Move 2:** 

Traded CJ McCollum, Larry Nance Jr. and Tony Snell to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Hart, Didi Louzada, Tomas Satoransky, a protected 2022 1st round draft pic, a 2026 2nd round draft pick and a 2027 2nd round draft pick. New Orleans and Portland both received a trade exception.

This trade is also terrible in hindsight. Joe made a bet that the Pelicans would not make the playin and lost. The 2022 1st did not convey and became a 2025 Bucks that eventually became Jerami Grant who we had to arguably overpay to keep.

**Move 3:** 

Signing Gary Payton 2 to a three-year 26.1 million contract that hard-capped us.

This signing was absolute shit because Gary didn't play for most of that year, wasting another year of Dame's prime. When traded back to the Warriors, the mitten went ahead and shat all over the blazers training staff in the whole toradol scandal. At least Joe was able to salvage 5 seconds from this trade.

**Move 4:**

Signing Jerami Grant to a 5-year $160 million contract.

This is a very bad contract for someone who is not even an all-star and will make more money than Booker, Brunson, and J. Murray this year. The reasoning we gave this contract to him was likely because Dame wasn't happy with the roster so we couldn't lose him (Joe said as much in the exit interviews that season) and this came out in multiple reports. Now we have another massive over-valued contract (same logic as people had against Olshey paying Norm his bag)

**Move 5:**

Trading Josh Hart for Reddish, Myhailiuk, and Arcidiacono and a 2023 lottery protected first.

Another bad move imo. None of the players are on the roster and the pick we received ended up being Kris Murray who has shown flashes but not the upside of his brother. 

**Move 6:** 

Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic for Ayton, Camara, Brogdon, Williams, 2029 1st-round pick, two first-round pick swaps with Bucks, 2024 1st-round pick, and a 2029 unprotected 1st-round pick.

This might be too early to tell but just looking at this year: 

Williams was injury prone and is out for the year. Who knows if he will ever be able to stay healthy on a NBA team. 

Brogdon has had issues with injuries all year, and when played has been a quality starter and a tradeable asset. But it seems he is looking for another contract and this screams Jerami Grant situation all over again. 

Ayton has been decent and great recently. His issues has never been talent though, it's been consistent energy level on the floor and that has shown up throughout this season. While it doesn't affect us much, he is overvalued at his contract. 

Camara has been a bright spot for the team this year. His hustle and energy is something that makes games actually fun to watch and he looks to be a solid contributor in the future.

Let's talk about the picks from this trade. The 2029 firsts are with Boston and Milwaukee. Giannis, Tatum, and Brown are all likely going to be in their primes and they have a competent ownership and front office so it's likely that these teams are still going to be competitive. These picks are more likely than not late first round picks. This is the same with the pick swaps. The warriors pick get's interesting if they don't make the playoffs but this is a bet from Joe, and he has previously been on the wrong side of a similar bet (CJ trade).


**Conclusion:**

Joe has been a sub-par to very bad GM in his tenure. He got his job as an interim and, in what seems like a cost saving move by the ownership group, he was promoted to fulltime GM without a proper candidate search. In three years as GM, he hasn't put together a competitive, **balanced** roster and has repeated the same mistakes as his predecessor and mentor in roster building; ""Oops All Guards"". For the team to turn the page, we need to likely clean house, **firing Joe Cronin, Chauncey Billups, and firing whoever negotiated this TV deal with Root Sports.** 

This franchise has been in a downward spiral ever since Paul Allen's passing and it's likely that we won't start winning again until Jody sells the franchise to an owner that wants to put the effort in and holds people accountable."
44,I‚Äôm so happy we have that pick,"I would like to thank:
Steph Curry for always selling in crunch time

Nikola Jokic for silencing Curry‚Äôs ass after he hit a night night against the injured rebuilding blazers

Joe Cronin for giving us that pick

46,MPJ a Good Comp for Risacher?,"Been watching a bit of film on Risacher and his game feels very similar to Michael Porter. Can shoot it and attack a closeout, but you'd never ask him to create for himself. Already looks to be a better (at least more consistent) defender than Porter. If that's the case, we could have a wing rotation similar to the Nuggets, as Camara is a similar player to Gordon. 

Ant is in the same ballpark as Murray. So, Cronin would just need to find a center in the second round that miraculously becomes the best player in the world! :) Easy peasy! Make it happen Joe!"

Instant regret, was that an opportunity to talk to him? Maybe ask for a signed Henderson jersey? Ask if I can meet the team? Put in a bid to buy the team? Who knows.

55,Notes from the MLK Day Remix game,"\- I'd recommend it, especially if you actually like hoop (and not just trade talk, narratives, etc.). NBA-level athletes playing hard in a small gym, pretty good. Wish I went earlier when Rupert and Murray were on the squad and will try to go in the future when I can watch promising rookies playing 20 feet away. 

\- Even if it's not the highest level ball it's hard to complain about a $15-20 ticket, especially when the home team wins

\- Chiles Center is a decent little venue (I've never been to any UP games), and at capacity would be rocking for a meaningful game.

\- Rip City Remix IPA - kind of a malty throwback, so just OK for me, YMMV

\- Merch is super-limited, and tbh I don't love the logo, so prob not for me

\- Had never seen Joe Cronin in person before - he's a BIG 6'6"" and I'd bet none of the Heat fans constantly talking shit to him would say anything in person. Seemed like a nice guy though.

\- George Conditt was balling out, and if we only gonna have 1 healthy center I wouldn't mind seeing him called up. First official member of the Conditt Hive here, lol."
56,This about sums it up. Are there any Heat fans left in here?,
57,Has the Blazers front office expressed any interest in any upcoming prospects or discussed future roster building priorities?,"Specifically I‚Äôm wondering if the public facing decision makers like Mike Schmitz or Joe Cronin have made any comments on prospects, or if they or any Blazer scouts/personnel have been seen in attendance to games which might tip their hands of who is on their radar?  

Broadly have they talked about their draft philosophies at all in terms of not what they‚Äôre looking for in an individual prospect but generally what they want to bring to the team in terms of priorities- ie Orlando with their tall ball where they valued positional size advantages, are there any roster building ideals that the Blazers front office operates off of?"

I am also a Blazers fan, having attended college in the state of Oregon. I did want Dame to go to the Heat, but I didn‚Äôt love the noise about it and the way it seemed to be happening. 

Joe Cronin did (and may still be doing) a fantastic job. Some pretty solid returns your way that I know the Heat realistically could and would not match. The Blazers, Bucks, and the Celtics are all gonna be really fun to watch the next season and beyond. Im happy to see how this all is playing out."
