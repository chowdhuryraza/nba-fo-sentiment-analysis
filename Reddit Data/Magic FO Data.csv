10,"Magic’s Weltman excited about rookies Black, Howard despite different paths","When the Magic drafted Anthony Black and Jett Howard with their pair of lottery picks in June, questions quickly — and understandably — popped up.

Why did Orlando need more guards? Where would they fit in? What’s their pathway to development?

Although some questions still remain about the future of the Magic’s roster, the franchise feels confident about the direction Black and Howard are heading in more than halfway through their rookie season.

“We’re really excited about both of those guys,” Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman recently told the Sentinel. “We’re excited about a lot of our players.

“That’s a reason not to bring in some sort of veteran player who can give you a temporary sugar high and then he goes away next year.  … And it steps on the development of these guys.”

The Magic stood pat at the recent NBA trade deadline because the organization values its positioning for a playoff push after the NBA All-Star break.

“We believe in our young players,” Weltman said. “When we had an injury and here comes 19-year-old Anthony Black, [he] steps up and we played well with him. I believe there’s not a guy on this roster that when called upon won’t step in and do well.”

Magic considered past, present and future by not making move at trade deadline

While Black (No. 6) was selected just five picks ahead of Howard (No. 11), their seasons have been notably different.

Black was thrusted in Orlando’s starting lineup just six games in after Markelle Fultz dealt with left knee swelling. After Fultz was diagnosed with tendinitis, Black started the next 27 games in his place.

Even when Fultz returned, Black remained in the primary rotation for weeks. It wasn’t until recently that the rookie returned to the Magic’s third unit where he opened the year.

Black’s 50 games played are tied for the sixth-most by a rookie. His 109.6 defensive rating leads all first-year pros who have played in at least 45 games.

Not only is he reliable on defense, he’s improved as a long-range shooter. In one season at Arkansas, he made 30.1% of his 3s. In Orlando, he’s shot 36.9% from beyond the arc, fifth-best on the team.

“Anthony came in and he played well,” Weltman said. “We’re very high on Anthony. We think he’s going to be a very good two-way player.”

Howard, however, has had to watch as Black has gotten the opportunity to play.

Of the top 14 lottery picks from June’s draft, Howard’s 13 NBA appearances are the fewest. The next closest are Utah’s Taylor Hendricks (UCF) and Indiana’s Jarace Walker (Houston), who have played in 17 NBA games.

Howard has spent the majority of his rookie campaign on assignment with Osceola, Orlando’s G League affiliate. His most recent stint there stretched from Jan. 21 to Feb. 10.

“Jett’s done really well in Osceola,” Weltman said. “Those guys are on different paths right now but we’re very high on Jett as well. He’s got a lot of gifts.”

Howard has averaged 20.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists during 32.5 minutes in 15 regular-season games with Osceola playing under coach Dylan Murphy. He posted similar numbers in six games during the G League Showcase in December.

Magic rookie Jett Howard develops in G League, sees benefits

When he’s played for Orlando, it’s been in limited time when the results of games  already have been determined. Howard has averaged 1.8 points in 3.8 minutes.

Although he hasn’t played much in the NBA, this was likely the reality from the jump for Howard. Weltman said on draft night that “guys are going to have to come in and earn what they get.”

To play for Mosley, that means defending — which is Black’s strength — while Howard is considered more of an offensive option.

Howard will have to continue to wait his turn.

The wait could be worth for it for the Michigan product, too.

Weltman envisions a future where Howard, a 37.5% 3-point shooter for Osceola, can help the Magic with their long-range woes. Orlando’s 34.8% from 3 is second-worst in the NBA.

“Honestly, when you talk about ‘the Magic need shooting,’ we expect Jett to provide us those things one day, but he’s got to go through his process as Anthony has to go through his, as all young guys have to go through theirs,” Weltman said. “Right now, the best pathway for Jett to get those reps to improve his game is in Osceola.

“It’s been a great place for him.”

11,Orlando Magic General Manager Anthony Parker hinted at Jett Howard (who spent his rookie season in Osceola) being in the rotation in his sophomore season today on @969gameon  “We think that he’s gonna be someone that helps us with a lot of the shooting that people say we need”,

14,"People who have questioned/disliked Weltman's rebuild strategy, are you on board now? ","I know many fans get angered by the lack of player movement but I can't help but feel Weltman/Hammond and now, Parker, have built this team exactly the right way. 

There's still the odd irrational fan that thinks Mosley should be fired and that we don't make enough moves, but surely we are well ahead of schedule/in an excellent position. 



The list of extremely good moves they've made that prove we have a patient, non reactive, well run group since the rebuild began (post Vooch/AG/Fourier - trade occurred almost exactly 3 years ago - March 26, 2021):

* Traded Vooch for WCJ + pick 8 (2021) + pick 11 (2023)


* Traded AG for Gary + Denver 25' first + Hampton (rip RJ) - Gary has since been re-signed on a 1+1 (team option) contract. 


* Re-signed WCJ on an extremely team friendly, declining 4y/50m deal. 


* Picked up Moe Wagner off waivers and signed him to a 2y/16m contract 


* Drafted Jalen Suggs #5 & Franz Wagner #8 (2021 draft) 


* Drafted Paolo Banchero #1 & Caleb Houstan #32 (2022 draft) 


* Picked up Goga Bitazde off Waivers and signed him to a 2y/2.6m contract 


* Drafted Anthony Black (#6) & Jett Howard (Pick #11) 


* Signed Jo Ingles (best player in the NBA) on a 2 year, 22m contract. 


* Re-signed Cole Anthony on a valuable contract 3y/39.1m contract 

* and arguably the biggest part of the rebuild - signing coach Mose. He's the best. 

I've definitely missed things. On top of being on pace to win 49 games this season and currently being the 4 seed in the East, Orlando are expected to have a Projected Practical cap space of $62,265,467 THIS off-season per sportac.com/nba/cap/2024/

We also have a tonne of very moveable contracts if we do one day consolidate. 

Dunno about everyone else, but I'm pretty stoked.
