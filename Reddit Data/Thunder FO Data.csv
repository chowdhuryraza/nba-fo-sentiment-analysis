“We want to thank Josh for his many contributions to our team and know he will capitalize on the opportunities before him in Chicago. 
 
When we drafted Josh in 2021 he was an essential aspect of our vision for the next iteration of the Thunder. Since then, our team has evolved rapidly and dynamically in ways we could never have anticipated. Therefore, as we began our internal discussions this off-season, it was determined that bringing Josh off the bench next season was our best option to maximize his many talents and deploy our team more efficiently over 48 minutes. 
 
As we laid out to Josh how he could lean into his strengths and ultimately optimize our current roster and talent, it was hard to for him to envision, and conversations turned to him inquiring about potential opportunities elsewhere. As always was the case, Josh demonstrated the utmost professionalism throughout the discussions. Josh has All-Star potential, but accessing that in the current construct of the Thunder would not be optimal for the collective. Based on these discussions we decided to move forward and prioritize what was best for the organization.”

5,"South Sudan head coach Royal Ivey: “I never knew I was going to be a coach. Sam Presti sat me down and said, ‘I think you can be a really good coach' —offered 2 paths, a cushy player development job with the Thunder, ""or there's the option to go to the GLeague and work for this guy, Mark Daigneault""","story by Jonathan Feigen

---

Ivey had returned from China, knowing on some level that he was through as a player but needing to hear it from Thunder general manager Sam Presti. Presti had followed Ivey’s career since he was an assistant with the Spurs and Ivey was a part of Rick Barnes’ second recruiting class at Texas. They had gotten to know one another in Ivey’s two stints with the Thunder.

“I never knew I was going to be a coach,” Ivey said. “Sam Presti sat me down and said, ‘I think you can be a really good coach.’ I said, ‘Oh, really?” I took a leap of faith.”

It was more complicated than that. Over dinner in Portland, Ore., Presti offered Ivey two choices, believing there was a better path for Ivey, but keeping that thought to himself.

“It’s never an easy conversation to have with a player,” Presti said. “They have to decide when they’re ready. But I thought it was the right time to put it on the table and see what he was thinking.

“When we were talking about what was next, what’s life after basketball was going to be, I was throwing out the idea of potentially going into coaching. I explained to Royal there were two paths we could take. We could do something in player development, and he could be around the Thunder … and stay in the world you’re accustomed to, in the NBA and all the benefits that come with it in terms of the travel and the luxury that we’re all afforded. Or there is the option to go to the G League and work for this guy, Mark Daigneault (now the Thunder coach.)

“I told him, ‘It isn’t going to be very glamorous. It won’t be a fun path, but it will give you the most exposure to the things you have the least experience with.’ And then, I kind of held my breath waiting for the answer, knowing that if he really wanted to excel and build a life after basketball that would be sustainable and strong, the G League path was the path. But I didn’t want to push that on him.”

Ivey chose to be an assistant with the Oklahoma City Blue, a decision that Presti said was choosing “the path less traveled” not unlike a kid from Harlem choosing to play for Texas, or that Ivey said was like becoming the South Sudan coach to “get out of my comfort zone.”"

22,Sam Presti 2nd Round Draft Tactics ,"Knicks fan coming in peace! I just wanted to share a post I made in the Knicks subreddit as I thought Sam Presti uses the same tactics as Leon Rose and it's genius! Let me know what you guys think :).





I don't think people realize what Leon Rose does in the 2nd round of the draft. I'm doing something research on his tendency of the second round and it's starting to make a lot sense. It seems like he generally has a target in the late first or mid to early second. He stocks up draft picks by continuing to trade back and even if he doesn't want a player in that current draft he uses the stockpile of 2nd rounders the Knicks always has accumulated to overwhelm a team to trade their 2nd round pick for multiple 2nd round futures because most teams don't value 2nd rounders.

 OKC does the same that's why we trade with them so often. OKC gave up the 5 2nds because they always will have surplus like the Knicks so they also will be able to draft their ""perfect"" team for.

 When you look at it, It's absolutely brilliant. That's why we get players like Deuce and IQ while OKC gets players like the center Jalin Williams or Aaron Wiggins. It's actually brilliant when you think about it.

42,Sam Presti & NBA2K,"I’m 42, and lived in Michigan my whole life. I say that because while I will always root for the Pistons, I became a Thunder fan not because of any player(s) or any connection to Oklahoma, it’s because I appreciate a great GM and Sam is the best. 

Now to my point after the context. How many of you can relative to playing NBA2K with any team and then getting to a point (after a few seasons) where you have really good players, but also seem to have 5 first round picks every single year? Usually once I get to this point where it’s basically not fair for any other teams at that point, I quite that franchise/dynasty in the game and start all over again and rebuild again from scratch. 

Sam Presti has done what we do in 2K. I truly believe the league will have to change rules in the future for what Sam will do for OKC. We often talk about this season or next, and discuss the future picks but don’t really dwell or discuss those picks and the possible circumstances. I know I’m not the first to do it , but it’s not discussed that often. With all of these picks people often say that Sam will have to make (lesser) trades because teams will “know” we have to get rid of some because we can’t pay them all. I don’t agree with that, I believe that every single year there will be a team(s) that is willing to sacrifice their future picks for a really good pick in that upcoming draft/on draft day. GM’s are trying to keep their jobs, if they don’t have a long leash they will make trades for shirt term success in order to keep their jobs and worry about the future later. This happens with coaches and GM’s every single season. It also means that the pressure pit on those GM’s might cause them to trade 1 really good draft spot selection for several future picks for their rebuilding team if Sam wants to move down and get the better prospect. 

I have said before, but I honestly believe Sam Presti will have movies and books made about how he managed OKC. I believe he will go down as one of (if not the) greatest GM in all of sports history where salary caps are involved. I’m happy to be an outside Thunder fan in 2024 who’s been telling people for years that they’d be title contenders very soon. They know that I’m not a bandwagon fan because they’ve heard me discuss it for years. I wish I could attend games to cheer those guys on regularly. Sorry for my random rant and ramble, and thank you for attending my TED talk. TTFU!"

53,Thunder to create their own twin towers,"Thunder projected to land ill-fitting, 7-foot-4 center this summer

By Mark Nilon | Jun 6, 2024, 9:20 AM CDT

Heading into the offseason, it's more than evident that the OKC Thunder must look to address their lacking size and physicality within their frontcourt rotation.

Even before the postseason began, these factors were viewed as severe weaknesses for Oklahoma City, and, ultimately, they proved to aid in their demise against the bigger and stronger Dallas Mavericks in round two.

This summer, Sam Presti and company will be hell-bent on adding on bigger bodies to their talent pool in an effort to help beef up their front line and, in a recent mock draft by The Ringer, writer Kevin O'Connor has the franchise nabbing towering center Zach Edey with the 12 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft to address this need.

Thunder land Zach Edey with No. 12 pick in latest 2024 NBA Mock Draft

Considering his 7-foot-4, 300-pound frame, O'Connor believes the Purdue senior to be a clear upgrade in the size department for OKC, while arguing his rebounding and rim-protecting skills could be a great luxury for the team, especially considering they ranked 27 in the former category.

*Whispers

Josh Giddey should be traded too"
55,Why Oklahoma City Should NOT Pursue Lauri Markkanen,"Regardless of what Sam Presti and Oklahoma City's front office elect to do this upcoming offseason, there is one move that they should resist: trading for Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen. Lauri Markkanen may be a highly-appealing trade target and an excellent fit on paper as a 7-foot sharpshooting power forward to pair next to Chet Holmgren, but there are certain deeper underlying issues for the Thunder to consider. Overall, despite being a popular trade target, I do not believe it is advisable for the Thunder to pursue him.

Why?

Here are three reasons:

Reason #1: **Cost Of A Trade** - it is well-known at this point that the Utah Jazz GM Danny Ainge will be asking for a huge haul in any trade. Although the Thunder have a lot of future draft capital, that should not be a reason for them to spend it exuberantly. The right trade and the right offseason target will arrive for the Thunder, be it this offseason, next offseason, or a future one. Going all-in on Lauri Markkanen likely would mean giving up a significant amount of future draft capital for the Thunder. Being too prodigal to satisfy Utah's demands in terms of the amount of future draft capital and potentially valuable first-rounders from the Clippers may not be astute. As a well-versed and seasoned GM, given this outlook and overall situation, it is likely that Sam Presti has already considered these factors when negotiating with Danny Ainge and the Jazz. Oklahoma City has an elite young core and a brilliant future ahead with loads of flexibility. As a great GM, Sam Presti knows this, and that he should not waste this. The team has shown that they can compete, and eventually contend organically, in the absence of a big move, at least as of right now.

Reason #2: **Extension Considerations** - in the event he is traded to Oklahoma City, Lauri Markkanen would likely want an extension of $40 million plus to remain on the Thunder. Financially, this would detract from future contract extensions for Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. This, in tandem with Lauri Markkanen's expiring contract and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's max contract, provides another reason to avoid pursuing him. Organic development is Sam Presti's mantra. Ultimately, it may be infeasible to pay all four of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren, and then Lauri Markkanen huge contracts as the Thunder from a financial standpoint, so this is something to be aware of in terms of the Thunder trading for Lauri Markkanen and the nature of his overall expiring contract. Building organically and extending members of their core may be more beneficial for the Thunder. Pursuing a player similar to Lauri Markkanen could be an option, but not one who is on an expiring contract and due for a significant extension, such as Lauri Markkanen. The Thunder have several highly important young players in need of extensions in the near future, a key organizational priority that the team has likely already accounted and planned for. With a bright future already secured, the organization is likely to prioritze caution from a fiscal standpoint and continued organic development, achieving success through incremental progress year after year.

Reason #3: **Cheaper Alternatives** - even if they not be as effective, the Thunder can look at trading for, signing, or drafting a cheaper alternative at PF if they want more size in the frontcourt next to Chet Holmgren with Jalen Williams at SF. Deni Avdija is often mentioned as a popular trade target for the Thunder, and while this is not to say that the Thunder should trade for Deni Avdija, cheaper alternatives exist at Lauri Markkanen's position for the Thunder to pursue. Whether it comes though the draft, trade, or free agency, the Thunder can acquire a similar player (even if this player may not be on Lauri Markkanen's level) while sacrificing fewer assets and maintaining financial prudence.

Please let me know if you agree or disagree. Although Lauri Markkanen makes sense from a basketball perspective, from a financial perspective and trade value perspective, he becomes less worth it as a trade target option for the Thunder to pursue. They should focus on building organically. The right star will come eventually at the right moment for the Thunder. Sometimes, when evaluating trade targets and offseason targets, it becomes more important to understand which players should **NOT** be an option and why.

**NOTE**: This is not to take away from Lauri Markkanen, he is a great player. Just providing context as to why he is not the right target for the Thunder.

Thoughts?"
56,And counting....,
57,[Schlecht] Confirming that the Giddey for Caruso trade involves no picks. Just a straight player swap.,

“JDub says Sam Presti made a great point to the team that you don’t know what people are going through that go to the games. If it’s a fan’s first game, etc. So he tries to make it a good time.”

How can you not love this guy?"
59,What is the Vision? Here it is (I think).,"So, the frustration is pretty high right now, some folks upset with the picks and some people upset at the folks who are upset at the picks. 

I wanted to take a step back and discuss the indicators Sam has given to what is happening with the team. And get more opinions on it. 

We can all agree the championship window is open. What, then, is the vision? 

Let's look at what Sam has said: 
>""[For us, we can't be emotional or impulsive,](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38802036/the-thunder-sam-presti-pivot-why-darlings-nba-preaching-patience) because if we do that, all the progress that we've made and all the investment that we've made will get multiplied by zero,"" Presti said. ""If you become impatient, irrational or give into those defaults, you can end up either stuck on the mountain or at the very bottom of the mountain again.""

>“[As I always say,](https://x.com/CAlmanza1007/status/1707054212020945095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1707054212020945095%7Ctwgr%5Ee89dea32bf7f99839c2685f667fa9a2756c6e43d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fokcthunderwire.usatoday.com%2Flists%2Frecap-okc-thunder-gm-sam-prestis-2023-24-pre-season-press-conference%2F) what we're after is sustained high performance for a long period of time.”   

He's also said, but I cannot find a link now, the problem with the first era was not having the assets to put the right players around WB/KD.  

>[Sam Presti on the No. 12 pick:](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/lists/live-blog-thunder-gm-sam-prestis-2023-24-end-of-season-press-conference/) ""When it comes to the draft, we're looking for the best fit for us. That's always been our mindset... We generally gravitate to a certain type of person and player... ""   

Another statement I cannot find a link for now is about the team not having enough playmaking off the bench.   
  

> [Presti](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/lists/live-blog-thunder-gm-sam-prestis-2023-24-end-of-season-press-conference/): ""Regular season you can win with the dribble. Postseason you win with the pass.  


Now an inference that I believe is fair:   

*If there had been a player in the draft who could help us immediately AND was a good fit he would likely have taken them There was no such player in this draft who could help now AND was a good fit based on how he drafted.*

The vision is this: with this draft he's begun building the next iteration of support players so we have flexibility if we cannot afford some guys or we can trade for more assets. It's that simple.

The off-season is not over, he'll make a move for size. If he can:  
1) trade away Giddey and get Caruso  
2) sign or trade for size  
3) begin working on the next set of assets to surround the core  

Then this off-season is a success. We are set to make the run and we are set to have long-term success.

Oh, and on Topic's shooting, from a comment by u/Available_Remove242:   

>Using everything that RealGM has, he is 75/230 from 3. Good for 33%. also, idk why you would use the stuff from the tiny sample seasons on there (which are also > 2 years ago and probably not that relevant to who he is as a player today), which is why I am judging based on the last 2 seasons. 70/208 from 3, 34%. Add in 209/236 from the line, 89% and you've got somebody who clearly has upside as a shooter imo. If you want to argue against using RealGM, that's your prerogative, but it has more data than I see anywhere else.

Give him a year with Chip and he should make progress. Free throw % typically translates. He's much better shooter than Giddey already. His data is skewed by the limited seasons as noted above. Kid can shoot. 

Tear me apart."
60,Lauri Markkanen,"Wouldn't trading for Lauri just ultimately take away from chet and Jdubs development? Allowing Chet and dub to develop over the season would yield a similar result to trading for Lauri to begin with, AND it helps with the cap. I don't believe we will get Lauri, but if we do,  would it not end up hurting our core development in the long run? "
61,In presti we trust ,
62,Cody Williams,"JDub’s brother, Cody Williams, has been posting a lot about the Thunder on his Instagram story. A lot of it is about Jalen, but he’s also posted about Chet yesterday and the score from last night’s game. All 5 of his story posts as of writing this directly relate back to Thunder basketball. 

Sam Presti, please, I’m begging you, do whatever you have to do to get this man on the team. I don’t care how many picks it takes. "
63,It’s time to forgive KD,"KD left OKC in a very bad manner and while I don’t agree with his decision leaving OKC it shouldn’t diminish everything he accomplished in OKC. He won 4 scoring titles, MVP, led this franchise to their first ever finals appearance at just 23 years old and invested millions in the OKC community. He put thunder basketball on the map and it’s just unfortunate that now all that gets thrown out the window. I also believe Sam Presti and Clay Bennett don’t get nearly enough criticism for trading James Harden away for a bag of chips and failing to surround KD and Russ, 2 MVP players in their prime with enough talent around them to seriously win. KD should’ve never left and should’ve never went to the warriors, it was a weak move but I think we should appreciate what he did for this franchise. Can’t tell the story about OKC basketball without Kevin Durant."
64,Thoughts on trading down for Zach Edey,"Don’t flame me just asking for opinion. The Thunder could trade the Heat their 12th pick and a future first for the 15th pick and Nikola Jovic. We can draft Edey and get a young promising forward to come off the bench that’s 6’10 and 205. Edey would also come off the bench but Edey averages 12.2 rebounds, 4.6 of those being offensive rebounds. Obviously one of the biggest holes we had was rebounding, well Zach Edey would solve that. Edey can score around the rim, he obviously won’t be our number one offensive option but if he gets the offensive rebound he can put it up pretty easily because well he is fucking 7’4 with a 7’11 wingspan. Plus if he gets fouled then Edey is also a pretty solid free throw shooter shooting 71% on 11.2 attempts which I think that percentage could only get better with some development. Now there is rumors going around that the Thunder will sign IHart in free agency but that would be a more expensive contract and Zach Edey could improve whereas IHart is probably at his ceiling. Either way we need a solid backup center and both could be solid options. But if we trade down for Edey and get Jovic that’s another solid wing that gives us more size and he is 21 with a 2 million dollar contract. 


Another thing Presti could do is draft Tristan Dasilva and then sign IHart. Dasilva is 6’9 and he is a solid wing option off the bench that shot 50% from the field for most of his college career, 39% from 3, 83% from the line. He would be like a taller Wiggins in my opinion 


Either way Sam Presti is a genius and I’m sure he will figure out how to make us champions, I personally never even thought about trading for Caruso and yet here we are, if we would have had Caruso in the playoffs we might be talking about how the Thunder won the chip. 
So that move alone bumps us up a notch along with all the development that Chet and j dub will have this off-season. "
65,With the twelfth pick...,"...and assuming he doesn't punt the pick into the future or consolidate to move higher, who would you like to see Sam Presti pick up? Whose minutes do you think will see a drop next season so a role would be carved out for them?"
66,I think we are getting Paul George.,"Reasons:
1: We are by far the best path available if he wants to win.

2: He and his agent have a great relationship with Presti.

3:  There have been no leaks or real buzz about the possibility recently.  These two teams (and player/agent) have shown the ability to make secret deals in the past.

4.  His last Thunder tenure ended with no hard feelings, and this trade keeps him in the Western conference.  OKC is a lot closer to LA than Philly…

5.  I just have a feeling Sam has one more big move he is going to make this offseason.  Kind of similar to the Celtics trading for Porzingis and then still going and getting Jrue last offseason.."
67,Off Season Thoughts,"How do you think Sam Presti is going to approach this off-season. Presti said before the season started that basically he needed to understand what this current team was lacking to then go on and make moves. He definitely got the data seeing that most of the players were healthy for a majority of the season. I personally think no big names are added. He drafts a backup center who can play with both Chet and JWill (I personally like the center from UConn) . Resigns Joe, Wiggins, and Giddey. And maybe adds some extra shooting wings to fill out the roster. On a side note looking forward to seeing Ousmane Dieng get some significant run next season."
68,"I truly think that if we get the chance, our FO will not pass up Cody Williams","First off, he is a good prospect. This draft class is rough and he is not bad value at 12 at all. He does have his concerns but so did JDub and look how he turned out. You just never know and he has that guys blood in his veins quite literally.

My second point is from the FO's perspective so completely hypothetical. But if I was them and we could make one of our stars very happy by drafting his brother I probably would. Especially because it's a good value and fit in theory.

At the end of the day im not Sam Presti though. Im sure whatever decision he makes will be the right one."
69,Something perfect about this being one of Deadspin's last articles.  ,
70,I'm glad rebounding was our demise,"I'm glad rebounding was our demise. Clear we needed rebounding at the deadline but instead we were gifted Gordon Hayward...

Clear as day now that we're not going to compete for championships without being able to rebound. As much as I love Chet, a combined *7 rebounds* in the two most important games of the season from our starting C is nowhere near cutting it.

Sam Presti's one of the best GMs in the league, full confidence he'll address our rebounding issues this off-season.

Still all-in-all an amazing season from the young crew, and excited for what the future holds. #ThunderUp"
71,Who is the Presti guy in the draft?,"Fellow Thunder fans who are into the draft and scouting. Which players in the upcoming draft you think fit the ""Pristi guy"" criteria?

Looking back to our recent selections I see that Sam prioritizes players who can defend well on and off ball, Can shoot or at least have promising shooting mechanics and of course good character.

I know things are different now since we are actually trying to win not just nurturing talents but I don't believe this will change how Sam drafts.

I think Reed Sheppard is the most Presti guy in this class. He is out of reach and as much is I like him I don't think he is worth trading up for.

Within our range ( the 12th pick) there are two players whom I think can be called Presti guys, Johnny Furphy and Kyshwan George. Both of them can defend 1-4. Lengthy wingspan and good shooters.

If we trade down and try to get 2 late 1st round picks older guys like Tristan da Silva and Kevin McCullar can contribute from day one. At least much more than what Gordon is giving us now ( I know it's a low bar but still).

I know most of the fan base wants another big but there is not a single big this year who fits the pattern of what Sam selected the past few years.."
72,"Gordon Hayward: ""The ball moves, the players move. Reading before they catch, making the right plays -- that fits right up my alley."" (From his media availability in OKC)",
73,"We Are Probably the Most Fortunate Franchise of the Last Almost 2 Decades, and I Just Want to Gush Over This Franchise for a Moment ","We are probably the luckiest and most fortunate franchise as a whole since our inception.

Think about all of the luxuries we've had:

3 top 30 players all-time on the team at the same time, right after our christening as a new team.

Finals run within 4 years.

7 superstars and future Hall of Famers (Russ, KD, Harden, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Domantas Sabonis), with the potential for at least 3 more in our current core alone (Shai, Chet, J-Dub)

One of the most winningest franchises over the last 15 years outside of San Antonio

We've been a part of SO much NBA history outside of our own team, including (but not limited to)

Being the team LeBron won his first title against

Knocking a contending Kobe and his Lakers out of the playoffs

Knocking the Big 3 Spurs out of the playoffs multiple times

Taking the greatest regular season team in history to 7 games in the conference finals

Being ground zero and the first NBA game affected by the Covid pandemic

Being the team LeBron was playing when he became the all-time leading scorer

Our players have been parts of so many mainstream memes -- the Russ ""WhAt?!"" meme, ""Mom made pizza rolls"", ""you the real MVP"", the Russ ""ahhh"" meme, etc. It's hard to think of another team that has players who were a part of as many mainstream memes as ours.

We have the best GM in the league by a mile, one of the best owners who seems to really care about the team and is not afraid to pay the tax when strategically necessary, one of-if not the best coach in the NBA who is also one of the youngest, the best scouting agents in the league, the most draft picks and it's not even close, arguably the best player in the NBA (will likely be within the next 2-3 seasons, or at least neck and neck with Luka and Wemby), we have one of the youngest cores in NBA history who are already one of the best teams in the league. Sam Presti is literally out here handling GM like he's playing NBA2K, it's unreal. Somehow our rebuild lasted 2 YEARS. There are teams out there who have been stuck in purgatory FOR DECADES. There's never been anything like what Sam has done, and who knows if there ever will be again.

There's no drama (aside from the Giddey thing, but that was unfounded and seems to be over), no egos, our team LOVES playing together in a way I've not seen in any other team I think ever, and it feels genuine most importantly. Our players don't flop, they don't whine to the refs, they're so incredibly likeable not only to Thunder fans but also to the entire NBA community. Sam is such a positive, genuinely good hearted person. Remember the last couple of season when he'd sign our two-way players at the end of the season even though the plan was ultimately to cut them, just so they could get some extra money to support themselves? Who else have you EVER heard of doing that? It's such a wholesome and compassionate move, and speaks volumes about how this franchise is built top to bottom.

The sky isn't the limit for our future, it's the galaxy. We are so incredibly set for the next decade that it's unreal. Not to mention the fact we have a new arena that thankfully was voted for, so we avoided the Seattle disaster, and they'll be here until at least 2050.... We are SO amazingly fortunate, and it's almost hard to believe it's real sometimes.

I just can't gush over this entire franchise and how amazing we have it. I have lived in OKC my entire life, I graduated high school the season after the Thunder moved here, and so I remember the dark ages before they came, and how much they changed our city and put us on the map and what they brought to our community.

We are so spoiled and I know my fellow Oklahomans and Thunder fans are passionate and love the team, but maybe some aren't aware of just how lucky we are comparatively to the other franchises out there. Look at Detroit, or Charlotte, or DC; we could very easily be them if Sam wasn't the literal wizard he is and we didn't have the amazing staff and players we do/did. I didn't think it was possible to replicate the high I felt during our first era when we were on top of the world and went to finals, but now I think Sam has pulled of yet another magic trick and has done it again.

Anyway, I just wanted to reflect on the incredible journey it's already been for us, and we're STILL one of the newest teams, so our history is just continuing to be written.

Hopefully this year we get to add a title to that resume?? :)"

75,Sam moves silent like the G in Lasagna.,
76,This is such a great pick,"Did we really expect someone to come in at the 12th spot in this draft and completely change our team? Topić is a guy that was projected to be a top 5 pick pre injury and is still just 18. With Josh Giddey gone we now have an elite passer that can fill the roll of commanding the bench unit and be an above average rim finisher. Sam Presti smashes another pick, cant wait to see him show out in the 2025 season. (Do some research first then come back this kid is a stud)"
77,Imagine getting fleeced by this man,Sam presti is my goat
78,"What Presti would never admit, and why: it's positive.....sorta","Preface: definitely didn't feel like listening to Sam's presser, so I didn't.......Now that I've decompressed from not getting Daron Holmes, and reading the heights and descriptions of our 2 picks listed in the OP,  I realize that this was Presti officially opening the tryouts for SGA's eventual replacement, based on age and cost.   That's how invested we are at sustaining this type of offense and defense, as a long term team identity.

In the here and now however, I speak for all thunder fans that would much rather get back to the business of locating the big men we need NOW, for 24- 25

ALTERNATE TAKE: Presti knows that SGA is an attractive archetype now, and wants to monopolize the market on this type of player, to be used for future deals of all sorts...

Presti is playing GM like an competing athlete also, just an intellectual one.

It's our entire organization against yours, at every level."
79,Please chill out,"Fact: Sam Presti is bar-none the best GM in the league.

We are just some armchair GMs with surface level information about trades, players, and values. I’ve been seeing a stupid amount of criticism directed towards Presti for our recent trade decisions and I think it’s a little ridiculous. We don’t have all the information and none of us have ever been a general manager of an NBA team, so how are we gonna put Presti’s decisions up against our own amateur takes and have the audacity to say he’s wrong. Cmon y’all…

Dort - The Dorture Chamber (gotta love this nick)

Josh Giddey - P. Giddey (this is probably not a good nick but hear me out ... maybe Josh needs more of a ""badboy"" image so teams will take him more seriously  ... I don't know it's bad I know)

J. William -JDub (I like this one so no need for a change)

Gordon Hayward - Mr. Bigfoot (when the team needs him, he's nowhere to be found ... this is obviously a joke).

84,Thunder Trade Targets,"The Thunder have given up 47.9 rebounds per game and 13.9 offensive rebounds per game to start this season while putting up 40.4 rebounds per game and 7.9 offensive rebounds per game.

Based on the current inability to guard bigs and rebound by the Thunder, I think a move needs to be made for a true big or this is another wasted year.

The following players are rumored to possibly be available this season due to discontentment, a reset of the franchise or contracts not being extended.  


Lauri Markennen - Obviously this would be the ideal target for the Thunder. 7 foot tall shooting near 40% from 3 and averaging 25ppg and 8.6 rpg.  His contract is up after next season and he does not qualify for a supermax due to switching teams twice.  Utah is in the race for the top pick in the draft and should take assets for Lauri to get a better pick given he likely won't resign with one of the worst teams in the league.    Salary of $17mil.  Projected trade:  Bertans + Mann or Dieng and lots of picks  


Zion Williamson - Lots of rumors that NOP is fed up with him and him with NOP.  Hardly ever plays but is one of the best pf's in the nba when he does play.  - Salary of $34M - Projected trade: Dort + Bertans + Dieng and lots of picks

&#x200B;

Jerami Grant - Portland is clearly tearing down to the studs.  Grant would be a great homecoming back to okc and is much better than when he played here.  Averaged 20.5ppg on 40% from 3 and plays great defense.  Salary of $27M - Projected Trade of Bertans Mann and Poku or Dieng and 1 1st and possibly a couple 2nds

Kyle Kuzma - Washington is tearing down to the studs.  21ppg 7rpg and 3.7apg at 6'10.  
Salary of $25M.  Would probably just take Bertans Mann and Poku and 1 1st or a few 2nds to pry him from WAS.

Daniel Gafford - Washington is tearing down to the studs-  Great rebounder and interior defender. Probably would only take a few 2nds to get him from WAS along with sending Bertans back.

Karl-Anthony Towns - His contract is up after this season and MIN is realizing he doesn't work with Gobert.  He can play the interior 5 next to Chet at the 4 or vice versa but brings the needed size, rebounding and scoring OKC needs.  Trade would be Dort + Bertans + Small Contract and likely multiple picks but would have to agree to resign or extend.

Sam Presti has refused to anything to help the team since trading for PG and Melo outside of the draft so I would doubt he would make a move at this point but all of these guys fit the glaring need that OKC has this season and would position OKC to be a deep playoff team for years to come.

88,2024 NBA Draft Prospects,"I’m interested in seeing who everyone’s been watching. From the last post draft presser, Presti said he’s looking for “2-way playmakers”, so that obviously means guys who make plays on both sides of the court. 

Now, we also run a 5-out offense, so that means whoever is drafted must be able to play stretch the floor, and/or put the ball on the ground. Ideally prospects that can play both on and off the ball, and switch defensively 

I know OKC doesn’t rebound well, but what you give up in the 5-out offense, so I don’t see Sam drafting a player that is one-dimensional, or doesn’t space the floor. I would say I don’t think Sam will draft another guard, but I thought that last year, too.

With that being said. Here are some of the prospects that fit the “dribble, pass, shoot, switch defensively” mold.

Tier 1: could realistically trade up for without gutting the team/core (mid lottery):
- Matas Buzelis, 6’10 big wing/forward - GLI

- Cody Williams, 6’8 big wing/ forward - Colorado

- Stephon Castle, 6’6 guard/wing - UConn

- Reed Sheppard, 6’3 guard - Kentucky

- Ja’Kobe Walter, 6’5 guard - Baylor

Tier 2: Will most likely be there around the Houston pick and/or potential Utah pick (late lottery/mid FRP)

- Tidjane Salaun, 6’10 forward/ big wing - Cholet (France)

- PJ Hall, 6’8 Forward/Small ball C - Clemson

Tier 3: Will likely be there around the Clippers pick (late FPR)

- Kal’el Ware, 7’ C - Indiana 

- Kevin McCuller Jr, 6’7 wing - Kansas

- Justin Edwards, 6’7 wing - Kentucky

- Bobi Klintman, 6’10 forward/big wing - Cairns (NBL/Australia)

- Aaron Bradshaw, 7’1 center - Kentucky

- Dalton Knecht, 6’7 guard/wing - Tennessee

- Trentyn Flowers, 6’8 wing/guard - Adelaide  (NBL/Australia)

- Tristan De Silva, 6’9 forward - Colorado

Tier 4: 2nd round options

- Grant Nelson, 6’11 forward - Alabama



Who do you like? Who am I missing? Thoughts?"
89,Statues at new OKC Thunder stadium,"With the news about some of the statues around the league being erected for former players and with the new clippers stadium rumored to feature a HOF walkway with statues of clippers players, who would you want memorialized with a statue outside of the new OKC stadium?

The first obvious choice is Westbrook. I would love to see a statue of Westbrook outside of the new arena and I don’t think that’s a controversial take at all. I also think Sam Presti should get a statue. Following up that thought, thought, is the decision whether or not to give Durant a statue. I’m not a fan of having his number retired for the Thunder, but in six years when they start putting the finishing touches on this new stadium, would it finally be time to recognize the legacy that KD had in OKC, what he accomplished for OKC basketball and the MVP that he won here?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m one of the biggest KD haters in the league, but wounds heal and scars fade. 13 years after his traitorous exit from our team, I think I would finally be able to support the idea of having his legacy memorialized with a statue in our beautiful city.

What do you guys think? Who else would you add?"
90,Now is the time.. ,"Sooo now that we know what we missing and need on this team, now is the time to cash in some of these picks right? I really hope Sam Presti is done with hoarding these picks and actually use them in trades this year.. I hope this Mavs series was eye opening for the organization and they make the necessary trades to fill in our gaps. What do y’all think? 

Edit: I believe Josh should be traded as well.. as much as I like the guy I just don’t believe he fits with the team very well any more.. "
91,"More Thunder rumors with alleged sources | Topic, McCain, or Edey at 12? Trade up for Clingan?

What are your thoughts on some of these prospects?"
92,PSA: Don't believe any leaks,"There are a lot of new Thunder fans joining the sub after our playoff run; first off, welcome.

Secondly, I would like to provide a PSA: Don't believe any rumors surrounding the Thunder. 

Sam Presti notoriously keeps everything under wraps and unless it comes from a reporter/staffer with some standing in the organization, no leaks are legit. "
93,Draft day is near,
94,Isaiah HarteHartenstein signing or a Nic Claxton (sign and trade)?,"Maybe the selection of Nikola Topic by Sam Presti @ 12 wasn't made with the Thunder even in  mind keeping him. 
   I imagine that the Thunder GM was pretty happy after draft selection 8 was  given that Zach Edey, Cody Williams and even Matas Buzelis were all still available. 
   Perhaps Presti saw that Zach Edey resembled Steven Adams, perhaps the Grizzlies owner who recently had Adams too, saw that and snapped him up.   Then Utah and Danny Ainge possibly just to F the Thunder over swooped in to grab Cody Williams.   Even Buzelis was such a high value proposition that he would have grabbed him had he still been there.   
   Now Presti knowing that the Brooklyn Nets, are both in rebuild mode after the Mikal Bridges trade knows that they might be eventually looking to have a player who might eventually fill Bridges position there and calls up Nets GM Sean Marks to work out a possible sign and trade for Nic Claxton.   I know that Nic Claxton signed that 4 year/$100 million dollar contract extension, but there is a strong possibility that it is still part of a sign and trade.   A Pelicans writer suggested that a sign and trade for Claxton might still be in the works for the Pelicans, but I believe that it's the Thunder since the Nets want picks and not Brandon Ingram.   
   I personally wanted the Thunder to draft Zach Edey at pick 12, he was gone, and also trade for Nic Claxton over a possible overspend for Lauri Markkanen!
   So would you prefer a sign and trade for Nic Claxton, given his $25 million a year hit, over an Isaiah Hartenstein signing by the Thunder?"
