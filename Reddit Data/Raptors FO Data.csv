15,"In a worst-case scenario where Siakam leaves for nothing, the Raptors should have a significant amount of cap space, which has almost never happened in the Masai Ujiri era","I'm sure the first though for many is that we suck at attracting free agents. But isn't this because we've rarely (if ever) operated as an under-the-cap team? I'm sure with real money to throw around for the first time since the We The North and championship eras came into existence, we shouldn't write ourselves off in this department.


Here's how the Raptors depth chart looks with players on the books for the 2025 season as it stands (all figures rounded for simplicity):

Quickley (13m cap hold) / Schroder (13m)

Barrett (26m) / Dick (5m)

McDaniels (5m)

Barnes (10m) / Boucher (11m)

Poeltl (20m) / Koloko (2m)

**TOTAL = 110m (105m for the above players + 5m for 4 incomplete roster charges)

Right now, it's widely expected that due to the new TV deal and changes announced in the CBA, that the NBA salary cap will [increase by it's maximum threshold of 10%](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10080144-nba-rumors-2023-24-salary-cap-increased-to-136m-and-165m-for-luxury-tax). This puts the 2024-2025 salary cap at 148m, and the luxury tax at 180m. That gives us *38 million* dollars to spend in a doomsday scenario where we find ourselves with Pascal and Gary still on the roster on June 29th, with no plans to return. Maybe not such an end-of-the-world scenario after all?

Here are some players that I see as being interesting to add to this roster with that money. Keep in mind that we don't need to be star shopping here...some of these guys just might be great fits and might see it as being attractive to play here given that we'll have both the money and a prime rotation spot to offer them. I've also excluded some of the more unrealistic targets like Klay, Holiday, Derozan, KCP, plus Siakam/OG/Trent. 

**Young Guys**: Nicolas Claxton, Markelle Fultz, Malik Monk, Obi Toppin, Jalen Smith, Isaiah Hartenstein, Moritz Wagner, Saddiq Bey, De'Anthony Melton, Patrick Williams, Luke Kennard, Isaac Okoro, Talen Horton-Tucker

**Discount Veterans**: Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Buddy Hield, Gordon Hayward, Kyle Lowry, Dario Saric, Kelly Olynyk, Gary Harris, Joe Harris

All this to say, I don't think we should force ourselves into a deal that isn't sensible if someone doesn't want to give us any proven talent for Siakam. The Raptors may be amongst a handful of teams that can dish out attractive contracts in the offseason. And it is especially valuable since we won't be competing with most of the major markets."

Not trading Fred Vanvleet in 2022-2023

Not trading Pascal Siakam

Masai seems to over-value some of his key players. Masai seems to get a reputation across the league that no other executives would like to deal with him due to the fact that they're never serious during trade negotiations.

We'll see how the Pascal Siakam situation plays out but if he walks out during free agency and the Raptors lose out by not trading him than maybe it's time we fire both Masai and Bobby Webster and look to hire another exec with a new perspective. "

35,Masai Ujiri’s Contract Incentive-Anti-Tank,"One thing I see a lot of people overlook about Masai is the contract that he signed with MLSE.  As a refresher he had a lot of options and MLSE had to provide a lot in order to retain him.  

According to articles from when he signed the details included:


According to Dobby and Smith, Ujiri’s contract with the Raptors includes a $15MM annual salary, with the ability to earn more in incentive pay if the value of the franchise continues to increase. Ujiri also received the new title of vice chairman to go along with his president title.

Wouldn’t Masai be losing money if we go into full tank mode? Both Rogers and Bell make money with viewership of the games through their channels and also ticket sales.  So it’s in their best interest to have a competing team rather than a tanking team that wouldn’t have as much viewership and many people would not pay top dollars to go watch them live."

44,The way this organization and fan base has treated Siakam lately has been borderline disgraceful - and we wonder why he's been playing poorly.,"Let's recap what he's meant to this franchise, shall we? Drafted as an unknown player who nobody wanted, he made the rotation from the start with energy, then quickly developed and improved. He worked his way up to 2nd option on the NBA champions, he's led this team in scoring for 4 straight seasons, made all NBA, all star, and has a case for top 5 Raptor in franchise history.

In the last few months, what has he gotten in return? 

\-Front office, Masai Ujiri in particular, indicating he was part of a ""selfishness"" core, leaving other unflattering comments, refusing to talk extension. 

\-Coaching staff that while praising him, has made a clear move to put Scottie in as ""the man""

\-Fans who have largely shitted on him, forgotten or moved on, and openly discussing trading him for some 3&D role players. Basically wanting him to get out of the way so Scottie can be king.

And despite all that, we expect him to figure it out, slide in as a #2 option again, and be really productive. With his ego, pride, role, all confused and bruised. You know how many times in league history guys who were THE MAN on the team willingly slid off to a younger up and comer, while still in their own prime, without being traded? It's a very short list, and we expect Pascal to accept it overnight. Even Monta Ellis thought he didn't deserve to hand the reigns to Stephen Curry, lol.

I really hope Pascal gets shown some more love, and finds his way, and becomes our apex second banana he can be. I haven't forgotten what he's done or meant for this franchise. "
45,"Masai to RJ in 2019: ""So just play inconsistently on purpose so that I can get you for cheap, then be the face of Canada basketball""",
46,"[Fischer] Toronto has made clear to all inquiring parties that Barnes stands as the Raptors’ franchise focal point, sources said. Any deal with Toronto could include recent first-round selection Gradey Dick, sources said,","From Jake Fischer's most recent article:

> At this juncture, Toronto and Chicago have been the two possible destinations for Lillard most discussed by league figures. While a collection of NBA personnel expect Portland to engage Miami before finalizing something with another suitor, the Heat have not factored primarily in the Blazers’ recent dialogue surrounding Lillard, league sources said. Additionally, the Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz have materialized as periphery teams that could factor into larger deals that help facilitate Lillard’s departure from the Blazers.

> Nurkic’s average annual salary of $17.5 million is roughly half of Ayton’s $33.2 million paycheck, so there’s additional accounting that would need to take place and satisfy this part of the Lillard puzzle. Adding perhaps the $18 million salary of Raptors forward OG Anunoby would help match the money, in the event that Masai Ujiri’s front office finally moves on from one of their prized core pieces, having flirted with several trade scenarios before the February deadline and throughout this offseason. All that flirting with little outcome — aside from adding back Jakob Poeltl — has left plenty of NBA figures skeptical Toronto will actually pull the trigger.

> Moving Anunoby and other compensation for Lillard, though, is a much different prospect than moving him for picks from a team like Memphis or New York. But what goes back to the Blazers? And if you’re Portland, could the chance of moving Anunoby rekindle conversations with suitors such as the Knicks and add to the greatest possible return Cronin’s staff seeks? Or, maybe Anunoby simply sticks around in Portland.

> There are plenty of avenues to evaluate, which makes the Raptors one of, if not the most viable threats to land Lillard outside of the Heat — similar to the Cavaliers’ surprise acquisition of Donovan Mitchell last September. Don’t count on Scottie Barnes, however, being the blue-chip centerpiece of Portland’s return. Toronto has made clear to all inquiring parties that Barnes stands as the Raptors’ franchise focal point, sources said. Any deal with Toronto could include recent first-round selection Gradey Dick, sources said, just like then-rookie wing Ochai Agbaji and then-rookie center Walker Kessler both functioning as additional draft compensation in Utah’s returns for Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, respectively, last offseason. In any deal with Miami, league personnel expect Portland to ask for the Heat’s recent first-round pick, Jaime Jaquez Jr., as well.

> It seems unlikely All-Star forward Pascal Siakam would fit into a package for Portland. Siakam is entering the final year of a lucrative contract and hasn't yet completed a pricey extension he’s eligible to sign. Paying Siakam would be a curious commitment from the Blazers after awarding Jerami Grant a five-year, $160 million deal in July, when Portland was not considered interested in backing Siakam’s next contract. And would the rebuilding Blazers really make long-term sense for an in-his-prime All-NBA talent?

> Anunoby does bring his own share of financial considerations. The 26-year-old swingman has a player option for the 2024-25 season, took meetings with several agencies before leaving Klutch Sports for CAA and informed various representatives, sources said, that he is looking for greater ball-handling opportunities that can result in a commensurate salary increase. Maybe there’s more of that chance in Portland, where Barnes’ development won’t stand in the way of Anunoby’s. It’s hard to imagine Phoenix fitting Anunoby’s next deal into its exorbitant payroll — as part of the three-team concept described above — but if there’s any ownership group currently willing to splurge to that degree, it’s this Suns leadership.

47,The price for Pascal?,"Hi, guys. Warriors fan here. I'd like to ask what would you see as a good enough return from the Warriors to trade Siakam to the Bay. 

Would the package of Kuminga, Moody and CP3 with 2027 protected first round pick be enough?"
48,"[Grange] In some corners there is an emerging view that another possible path may present itself, one where Siakam doesn’t get moved and may even end up inking an extension in the coming weeks. It wouldn’t surprise me if there have been exploratory conversations on the subject.","New Grange article dropped. Here's the interesting parts to me:

>	Pascal Siakam has had his future kicked around the Internet for almost a full year now. Not that it didn’t happen before that, but since the Toronto Raptors season began unravelling this time 12 months ago, and on through the February trade deadline last season and then through the summer, the two-time all-NBA forward has been front-and-centre when it comes to trade speculation. 

>	It’s not something he’s asked for — quite the opposite, as Siakam has signalled his preference to stay in Toronto at every turn — but it’s part of the business. 

>	“I don’t worry about that. I just live my life and try to be the best I can be every day,” Siakam told me after wrapping up practice in advance of the Raptors crucial four-game homestand that tips off with the first of two games with the Atlanta Hawks Wednesday. “I don’t think about it. It’s not part of what I do. I control what I can control. I’ve always understood that, and I’m getting better at it and I’m actually really good at it now.”

_________________________________________________________________________________

>	It’s fitting that the Hawks are in town as the NBA calendar flips to Dec. 15, unofficially marking the opening of the league’s trade market since — with some exceptions — it’s the date that most players who were signed to new contracts this past off-season can be included in deals. 

>	The Hawks and Raptors discussed various permutations of a trade for Siakam this past summer, with things advancing enough that Atlanta had contacted Siakam’s representation to take measure how open the eight-year veteran would be to signing an extension with the Hawks if the deal went through. 

_____________________________

>	And full marks to Siakam too for aligning himself with Rajakovic and carrying himself professionally even as the business of basketball could have easily caused a fracture. Rather than sulk about not having a new contract yet and having been on the trading block for months, he’s giving every signal that he remains committed to figuring out a way to generate team success. In his mind, the struggling Raptors are in a fight and it’s no time to sit stay in his corner. 

_________________________________________________________________________________

And the full extension part:

>	According to league sources I’ve spoken with there is expected to be a fairly robust market for the Raptors veteran, though maybe not the slam dunk of return that makes the deal a no-brainer. The Raptors, under president and general manager Masai Ujiri, aren’t known for selling low. 

>	Which is why in some corners there is an emerging view that another possible path may present itself, one where Siakam doesn’t get moved and may even end up inking an extension in the coming weeks. It wouldn’t surprise me if there have been exploratory conversations on the subject. 

>	It’s not so much an inflection point, but it is a moment on the calendar that could drive some momentum for a decision, one way or another. 

>	The logic plays out like this: If the Raptors sign Siakam to an extension between now and the end of December, they would be giving up the right to trade him for six months, so he would be off the table for the upcoming trade deadline. 

>	It could work out in the longer run, however. If the two sides did reach an agreement on an extension by say, Dec. 28, Siakam would be eligible to be traded six months later, on June 28, 2024. The Raptors would essentially make themselves players in the trade market next summer — as they were this past summer — the difference being Siakam would be under contract and presumably a less risky acquisition than he was as a pending free agent. 

>	The same logic could drive trade activity in the short term: if the Raptors don’t see themselves reaching an agreement on an extension with Siakam before Dec. 30, it might spur them to move him sooner than later. Not only would the acquiring team get Siakam for the rest of this season, but they would also have a precious few days to negotiate an extension with Siakam using his ‘Bird Rights’ (which would allow his new team to offer a richer deal than he could get on the open market) before the market opens (officially) to the rest of the league on July 1. 

>	It’s something to watch over the next few weeks and create an environment where the Raptors and Siakam could become mutually aligned: if – after nearly a year surveying the market – the Raptors haven’t got an offer they find satisfactory, they offer an extension to Siakam to keep their window open until they do, and Siakam gets a deal. 

>	It might require some flexibility on term and dollars, but it might be an interesting path for each side to explore in the coming weeks.

Finally something that actually makes sense to me. This should have been how it was done in the summer, doing it now is also logical if the trade market isn't robust. Inking him to an extension before the end of December would make him trade eligible by draft night, and he would have term under his contract which should boost his value.

My preference of course would be to trade Pascal because it'll open up more opportunities for Scottie and make it easier to keep OG, but if the trade offers are still trash, then I'm perfectly content to extend him and revisit this in the future when he has term on his contract."

Raps have 1 more spot open for camp after the Bruno Fernando signing. I’d imagine they’re likely keeping it open in hopes Koloko gets cleared, but shouldn’t be hard to find someone for that spot later on if they want.

Also good to note “Koloko would have no problem coming back to the Raptors”, because some people thought he wouldn’t want to come back because we waived him.

50,When Masai was negotiating his extension contract in Aug 2021 he was seen as the #1 GM in the NBA. Where do you think he ranks now?,"Back in August 2021, when Masai Ujiri was negotiating his contract extension, there was a widespread consensus in the NBA community that he was the top general manager in the league. His reputation was stellar, thanks to a series of successful decisions and strategies that significantly impacted the team's performance. 

However, as we stand today, the landscape of the NBA has evolved, and several other GMs have also made notable strides in their respective organizations. Also, Masai missed trading FVV in his prime and let him walk to nothing.

Considering these changes and the ongoing dynamics of the league, where do you think Masai Ujiri ranks now among NBA general managers? Let's discuss his current standing, the decisions that have defined his tenure since 2021, and how he compares to his peers in today's NBA landscape."
51,A Speedrunner's Guide to the 2024/25 Season - And Why Tanking Won't Be on the Menu for the Toronto Raptors,"The 2024/25 Toronto Raptors season is going to be an interesting one to watch.

Between a frequently teased rebrand ahead of what will be their 30th season and the team retooling round their now uncontested face of the franchise in Scottie Barnes with both established talent (RJ Barrett, Davion Mitchell and Immanuel Quickley) and rookies looking to prove their own (Ja'Kobe Walter, Branden Carlson, Jamal Shead), the Raptors have a lot of moving parts going in to what will be a historic year for the franchise.

# To Tank, or Not to Tank:  Looking at the Rest of the League

One of the more highly debated topics of late is whether the Raptors should tank in the 2024/25 season, usually in conjunction with trading Jakob Poeltl to make the team worse.

To be sure, adding one of Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey, Khaman Maluach or even brother of Raptors Legend Ron Harper Jr. in Dylan Harper, among whomever else ends up being a projected top pick in the 2025 draft would be a positive for the team.  Talent is talent and having a cost-controlled rookie with high upside only further raises the ceiling for a team mired in the midst of a rebuild, retool, whatever you want to call the team's current status.

Ignoring that there is no guarantee the Raptors will get a Top 4-5 pick in this draft should they somehow end up with a bottom 4-5 record come season end, that Masai Ujiri-run teams generally avoid tanking to start the season (Trading Rudy Gay and shutting things down in the Tampa Tank that landed Scottie were mid-to-late decisions informed by a bad losing streak for both - and the former ended up making a turning point for the team as the 2013/14 Raptors ended up making the playoffs), or that Masai Ujiri's own contract is coming up for renewal as it expires in 2026 will incentivize him and Bobby Webster to put forward a competitive team that makes the play-in or playoffs outright sooner than anticipated (which should serve to inform why the Raptors went with known talent in the O.G. trade over picks via Quickley and RJ)...the proposition fails to answer a simple question.

Barring another season-ending injury or some other unforeseen turmoil that changes the season early on like a tough opener that leads to an unexpectedly poor record like going 3-12 in the first 15 games, how exactly are the Raptors going to out-tank the bottom feeders in the East?  There's 15 teams in the conference and only 5 of them miss out on the postseason outright, albeit only 8 will make the playoffs outright.  In order words, of the teams who don't appear to be a lock for the playoffs, 4 of them have to make the 7/8 and 9/10 play-in tournament, regardless of their record.

In other words, of the Pistons, Wizards, Hornets, Raptors, Hawks, Bulls and Nets, two of those teams have to make the 9/10 play-in game, regardless of whether they're a 0.500 team or if there's an enormous gap between them as the 9/10 seed and whomever is the 8th seed.  So let's forget whatever Vegas says the odds are for Toronto's over/under and take a brief look at the rest of the bottom half of the Eastern Conference's landscape to see what the Raptors are going up against:

*Detroit Pistons*

* As much as one can criticize the **Detroit Pistons** for overpaying a player who went 0/2 in the 76ers elimination game, acquiring him is a talent upgrade
   * This should speak for itself as to the level of talent of Detroit so don't expect them to be in the running for a play-in spot when the 5th pick in the draft has their name written on it.  They aren't going to be very good though they should be better than the franchise-worst record they ended with
   * Additionally, it worth noting that while LaMelo Ball has been highlighted for his inability to stay on the floor, Cade Cunningham has had similar bouts with his health in trying to stay on the court, most notably with him missing the vast majority of his sophomore season following a rookie season that started slow due to him recovering from a preseason injury to his lower body
   * It is possible one of the Pistons young players like Jalen Duren have a breakout year but expecting all of them to improve is unrealistic given Detroit's recent history with struggling to develop their lottery talent

*Washington Wizards*

* The **Washington Wizards** are still going to be awful, arguably they'll be even worse than they were last year with Kyle Kuzma potentially being on the trade bloc and Tyus Jones return not being guaranteed
   * The latter is important because that means the ball will likely be in Jordan Poole's hands far more than one would like
* The addition of several new rookies like Bub Carrington and Alex Sarr - the latter of whom has been getting...a lot of criticism for his play in Summer League (because he's been really bad) - are similarly unlikely to make a positive impact though both were selected for their long-term upside and not expect to make meaningful contributions to winning basketball in their debut season

*Charlotte Hornets*

* The **Charlotte Hornets** have been good enough to make the play-in as a 9/10 seed in prior seasons when LaMelo has remained healthy...
* ...the problem is both Ball and Mark Williams have been struggling to stay on the court

*Chicago Bulls & Brooklyn Nets*

* I'm wrapping these two up together because their status is similar and straightforward:  Both the **Chicago Bulls** and **Brooklyn Nets** have gotten significantly worse after trading their best players in DeMar DeRozan and Mikal Bridges respectively, and both either barely made or missed out on the play-in's 9/10 matchup in their most recent season
* The Bulls didn't make the playoffs for those who weren't aware, though they did manage to beat the Hawks in the 9/10 matchup and the Nets straight up fell out of the race in the final stretch of the season despite trying to win due to not owning their 2024 pick at the time
   * Chicago in particular is going to be incentivized to tank so as to keep their pick as it's currently owned by the Spurs; it's Top 10 protected for the season and while the protections do get weaker in 2025/26, they're manageable for the 2024/25 season at minimum
   * Additionally, the Nets are open to trading more of their players like Cameron Johnson and thus could very easily become worse than they're already expect to be
      * An aside but I think there's a good argument that the Nets will be the absolute worst team in the league next year even if they do hold on to valuable roleplayers like Dorian Finney-Smith or the questionably available (due to injury, not in terms of if he's on the trade bloc) Cameron Johnson.  Anyone who watched the Raptors last year should be able to attest that a team where Dennis Schroder is leading your team in shot attempts is probably going to lose those games where he's the leader in attempts

*Atlanta Hawks*

* The **Atlanta Hawks** have been consistently in the running for the play-in in 3 years straight and are returning mostly the same core along with newly acquired 3 and D wing/1st overall pick in Zachary Risacher
   * While the fit was not ideal, losing Dejounte Murray for Dyson Daniels is a straight up talent downgrade; part of the reason the Hawks were in the play-in running this year was because Murray was able to keep them afloat while Trae Young was out due to injury.  It is hard to see new additions like Zachary Risacher or 3rd year Dyson Daniels making a similar impact
   * It's worth mentioning that Clint Capela has been in severe decline despite what the statline shows, and with the team's apparent apprehension to start Onyeka Okongwu as the team's starting center, it's an open question as to how their defense will hold up with Clint being the presumed starter at the 5.
   * At the same time, it is also worth noting that the Hawks are reportedly ""not done making moves"" and with the two firsts they acquired from the Murray trade and tradeable (Note:  I said tradeable, not good) contracts in De'Andre Hunter and Clint Capela, it is not out of the realm of possibility for Atlanta to put together a more well-rounded roster - and given they have no pick control barring a Nets-like trade with the Spurs to get their picks back, they have zero incentive to be bad for a top pick

This is without us even mentioning the Western Conference.  While there's likely to be a bloodbath with teams vying for a spot that, should they not make the playoffs as the 7th/8th seed, teams like the Portland Trail Blazers are likely to be near the bottom of the conference with a similar sub-30 win record to the Wizards or Pistons and while the San Antonio Spurs have a generational talent in Victor Wembanyama, that's all they really have going for them at the moment aside from an ancient Chris Paul - and it's not like they won more games with Wemby than they did the prior season.  The Utah Jazz are similarly poised to potentially post a poor record in this race to the bottom should a trade for Lauri Markkanen come to fruition or they shut him down due to an injury (It's worth noting Lauri hasn't played 70 games in a season at any point in his career and he's only played more than 60 games 3 times).

Additionally, there's always a ""lottery wildcard"", that one team that should be in the playoff picture but underperforms relative to expectations due to injuries, an impactful suspension, chemistry issues, etc.

* In 2021/22 that was the Kawhi-less Clippers going out in the play-in (That lottery pick went to the Thunder who selected Jalen Williams, for the record)
* In 2022/23 that would be the Mavericks whose midseason acquisition backfired and the team ultimately intentionally lost the last game of their season to keep their pick (albeit it lead to them getting 10th in the draft and that led to them trading down to dump Davis Bertans contract while also acquiring the impactful rookie Dereck Lively).
* In 2023/24, that was the Grizzlies losing Ja twice, once to stupid brandishing of a firearm pre-season leading to a heavy suspension and once to a season-ending injury that simultaneously finished off the team's chance at a play-in run (They did end up with the 9th pick and selected Zach Edey whose impact on the team is TBD).

Who will be that wildcard in 2024/25?  Who knows!  While it's possible it's the Raptors this year due to an untimely injury a la the 76ers in 2023/24 who wound up underperforming due to Joel Embiid being injured for a prolonged period of time, if the Raptors are healthy, it is very hard to see a world where Toronto isn't in the play-in race along with the Atlanta Hawks for the 9/10 matchup simply due to how bad the rest of the East is. While it is possible the Hornets do eke out a slightly better record if Ball manages to stay healthy alongside Mark Williams and sophomore Brandon Miller, if that is not the case, and Raptors both make the play-in but fail to make the postseason overall, then it is equally hard to not see the Raptors in a similar spot in the 2025 NBA lottery as the Hawks or Bulls were in 2024 i.e. somewhere in the latter half of the lottery from 8 onwards...

...and that's fine, I guess?  At least for where the team currently is.  Talent is important and the Raptors would obviously be better off with Cooper Flagg than without but the best-case scenario for them is a 14% chance of getting him, Bailey or whomever you pin as Scottie's co-star of the future.

Moreover, the Raptors being in a situation where they have those odds being described as ""the best-case"" belies the fact that something has to have gone horribly wrong for them to have those odds in the first place i.e. Scottie having two seasons with injuries bad enough to take him out for a lengthy period of time or several players having a career year in the worst way possible.

That's not to say the Raptors are set up for some future dynasty with a young core at nearly every position a la the OKC Thunder.  This team's roster does still have some major holes.  It's lacking in wing depth, the center rotation is up in the air as the presumed backups are both on two-way contracts (assuming Christian Koloko isn't cleared or doesn't sign with the Raptors, both of which are not out of the realm of possibility) and the number of rookies on the team does make it likely the bench is unlikely to see some serious contributions for the NBA debut of many of Toronto's youngest players - Ja'Kobe Walter is 19 and will be 19 until September, Ulrich Chomche is one of, if not, the youngest player in the NBA, etc. - but that's part of how rebuilding/retooling a team works.

It takes time, talent and some luck in either hitting on a trade or two, not to mention on one's prospects developing, and making the play-in should be seen as part of that all-important development factor.  Sure, it's not the same as playoff experience but it is a similar environment and it shouldn't be seen as negatively when there isn't much of an alternative.  Just look at the timeline of the Raptors from the first season without Chris Bosh until 2018 where they were seen as contenders:

|Season|Major Moves & Notable Accomplishments|Record & Results in the Postseason|Draft Results/Selections|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2010/11|Sign and traded Chris Bosh in the offseason and got their pick back, a Miami first they traded for James Johnson and a giant expectation that Brian Colangelo wasted|22/60 (3rd worst in the NBA)|Dropped from 3rd to 5th, drafted Jonas Valančiūnas|
|2011/12|Lockout season; signed Dwane Casey to be their head coach; the team was mostly the same as last year and they made very few moves after the draft aside from adding former All-Star Jamaal Magloire|23/43 (Tied for 7th worst record in the NBA)|8th pick (^(Lost a coin flip with the Warriors who got 7th)) and drafted Terence Ross|
|2012/13|Traded for Kyle Lowry in the 2012 offseason, Rudy Gay midway thru the season|34-48 (12th worst record in the NBA)|Tried to trade for Giannis but failed to after trading this year's pick to acquire Lowry; they did not own a 1st in this year's draft|
|2013/14|Signed Masai Ujiri to become the general manager for the Toronto Raptors in the 2013 offseason; offseason also involved the infamous Bargnani Knicks pick; traded Rudy Gay midseason for, among other players, Greivis Vásquez who would become the start of a currently ongoing trade tree; Gay's trade would mark a turnaround for the team as they would end up finishing the season strong|48-34 (3rd in the East); lost in 7 to the Nets|Ended up 20th where they infamously selected Bruno Caboclo|
|2014/15|For the team's 20th anniversary, the team overall didn't make many moves during the season but they did give Vince Carter a tribute in honor of the occasion; after a first-round exit they made the aforementioned Vásquez trade that eventually became RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and, most recently, Johnathan Mogbo after several future trades|49-33 (4th in the East); lost in 4 games to the Wizards|Once again ended up at 20 where they selected Delon Wright; traded Greivis Vásquez for the 2nd rounder that was Norman Powell in this draft and a future Clippers first in 2017|
|2015/16|First time the Raptors had 2 All-Stars in a single season since Antonio Davis and Vince Carter back in 2001, a streak that would continue until 2020/21 where no player was selected for the All-Star Game; this was the year they infamously signed DeMarre Carroll who they would end up dumping him with their 2018 1st and several seconds|56-26 (2nd in the East); won in 7 against the Pacers in the 1st round, won in 7 against the Heat in the 2nd round, lost in 6 during their first ever Conference Finals to LeBron James|The pick from the Bargnani trade conveyed at 9; the Raptors made 2 first round selections with Jakob Poeltl at 9 and Pascal Siakam at 27, with Fred VanVleet signing in free agency as an undrafted free agent|
|2016/17|Midway through the season after a lengthy losing streak, the Toronto Raptors would make a trade to acquire Serge Ibaka from the Magic for Terence Ross & a future first; their G League affiliate won the G-League championship & Siakam was named Finals MVP|51-31 (3rd in the East though their record was tied with the Cavs); won in 6 against the Bucks in the 1st round, swept by the Cavaliers|The 1st from the Vásquez trade conveyed at 23rd; the Raptors didn't own their pick due to the Ibaka trade but they used this pick to select O.G. Anunoby|
|2017/18|Franchise-high win record with 59 wins; the Raptors were seen as true contenders due to LeBron James having the worst constructed Cavaliers team during his second tenure|59-33 (1st in the East)|The pick from the Carroll salary dump conveyed and no 1st round selection was made; we all know what happened next|

This is far from a definitive summation that ignores the nuance and general improvements from both the starters and bench over this time period - and it does overlook some of the other, less notable mistakes made along the way - but it should serve to illustrate that whatever you want to call what the Raptors are doing now, becoming a regular playoff team, let alone a contender, takes a long time.

# What about Jakob Poeltl?

Like I said earlier, part of the ""tank/no tank"" discussion has been centered around Jakob Poeltl and whether the Raptors should trade him.  The Raptors themselves have, per Lewenberg, [explored trading him but haven't progressed far](https://www.tsn.ca/nba/video/~2952391) on any talks about him, and it's up in the air if Poeltl is particularly happy being on a team that is probably not going to make the playoffs outright as a Top 6 team.

This really should be given its own deeper dive but to keep the focus on expectations for the 2023/24 season and the Raptors in particular, i'll say this:  While Poeltl absolutely shouldn't be treated as untouchable and while his long-term fit with Scottie is questionable due to his lack of range, his absence is not going to be the difference maker in getting into getting some of the best odds of a Top 4 pick in what may be a historic draft on a team that's likely to be sub-0.500 with or without him.

The Raptors were bad without Poeltl last season but the constant regurgitation of the with/out record ignores that they were also without Scottie Barnes during that same stretch, not to mention both RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley were out due to their own respective family tragedies, not to mention RJ was dealing with an knee issue and playing through it at one point.  Poeltl certainly makes the Raptors better, he's a good player and that's what they do, but by how much is not as clear cut as looking at their win/loss record with/out him.

If you're trading Jakob Poeltl, it should be because you got a stupid good offer from a desperate team rather than hoping for slightly improved lottery odds.  Anyone who's seen the Pistons drop down in back-to-back-to-back drafts to 5th can tell you that that the NBA lottery is aptly named:  Sometimes you win it big (Getting number 1 in 2021's lottery and drafting Cade) and sometimes you drop from where you were expected to go in 3 consecutive drafts.

There are no guarantees in the lottery, something the Raptors should be keenly familiar with given they lost out on their own pick in this year's draft due to bad lottery luck while simultaneously jumping up from 7th to 4th in 2021 to draft Scottie Barnes.  Just as the draft itself is a crapshoot, so too is the lottery that determines who gets to draft where.

Hell, if we want to extend this out to look at the Raptors general history with the lottery, they've dropped down far more than they've jumped up.  In terms of major leaps i.e. jumping up more than 1 spot, getting 1st overall in 2006 while having the 5th best odds and 4th overall in 2021 with the 7th represent the exception rather than the rule.

[They stayed put in 2012 and 2013, for those wondering; from 2014-2021 they weren't in the lottery aside from the pick that became Jakob Poeltl; that pick stayed put at 9.  Also worth mentioning their first draft pick was the result of a coin flip for 6th that they lost to the Vancouver Grizzlies.  Also also this graphic messed up the pre-lotto\/results for 2006; they had the 5th best odds and jumped up to 1st from 5th to take Andrea Bargnani.](https://preview.redd.it/ljy9nrh59led1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=99230ab0f13d52d2ea7cc1597d14d71e38b01e3e)

There's also the fact that getting a good pick in the lottery is not a guarantee that the player selected will develop into an impactful player, let alone an All-Star/All-NBA caliber franchise piece.  To be clear, Jakob is not the latter but for all his faults, Jakob Poeltl is a known talent and while his status a ""Top 10 center"" in the league like Masai claimed when making that foolish trade for him instead of blowing up the team at 2023's deadline is debatable, he's valuable for what he brings as a defender, interior presence, screener, pick and roll recipient and an underrated passing big man who's on a perfectly reasonable contract.

He's far from untouchable - if the Knicks offer, like, Mitchell Robinson, 2 firsts and a swap then you take that deal because it's a ""too stupid to not take that deal"" offer (For the record, I don't think this offer would be on the table if we're being realistic) - but he's also not someone you just trade for the sake of making your team worse in his absence for the sake of what can be best described as minimal gain in this year's lottery.

# On Expansion

I feel like it's oft unmentioned that expansion is on the horizon, mostly due to the ongoing media rights negotiation and the recent drama regarding said rights and the opportunity to match any current deals (TL;DR the new TV deal is a mess)...but it's coming and expansion will impact *every* team.  Some of them will be affected more than others - the Timberwolves will likely be moving into the Eastern Conference due to how far they have to travel right now to face off against Western Conference teams - but every team is going to be affected by this.

How will this affect the Raptors?  Well, we're not sure yet beyond the usual ""protect 8, everyone else is up for grabs"" that comes with NBA expansion i.e. one of the Raptors current players could be taken in an expansion draft (One would assume the Raptors would protect their 4 starters from the last season, Ja'Kobe, Dick and Shead; the 8th player is up in the air and i'm not clear on whether Davion could be protected if he's not extended as he'd be a restricted free agent).

What can be said is that, once the dust settles on the media rights, the NBA is rumored to shift its focus on adding two new teams, and beyond the expansion draft, there's the inaugural draft which said teams will be a part of.  Whether or not this will be in 2025 or 2026, consider this a sort of refresher on how these new teams could affect the Raptors standing in the draft should these new teams (or if the Seattle Supersonics return, the old and new) wind up.

The NBA has a pretty lengthy history of expansion, be it brand new teams like the Bulls being introduced in 1966 or through existing teams via the merger of the ABA back in the 70s, with the league most recently adding the Charlotte Bobcats in 2004 to bring the number of teams in both conferences to an even 15 for each.

As far as it relates to the draft, the Top 3 (now Top 4) have not been affected in previous expansions of the league but the teams below that threshold are...a different story.  To keep this simple, let's quickly look at the two most recent times the NBA expanded:  The aforementioned Bobcats in 2004, and the Canadian expansion draft that saw the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies introduced to the NBA.

2004 - NBA adds the Charlotte Bobcats Bobcats are given the 4th pick in the NBA Draft

* The team(s) that would have drafted 4th-15th dropped one slot from their post-lottery position
* The Bobcats traded up to draft the 2004/05 Rookie of the Year Emeka Okafor 2nd overall

1995 - NBA adds the Toronto Raptors & Vancouver Grizzlies; the two teams flip a coin for the 6th pick & the Grizzlies won 6th

* The Grizzlies drafted All-Rookie 2nd Team Bryant Reeves 6th overall
* The Raptors drafted 1995/96 Rookie of the Year and ""man who led an expansion team to delivering the 96 Bulls one of their 10 losses"" Damon ""Mighty Mouse"" Stoudamire 7th overall
* The team that would have drafted 6th pre-expansion wound up 8th as a result of these two new teams

This is a vast oversimplification of the expansion process since those Canadian teams had a number of franchise-altering stipulations related to the draft such as not being able to win the 1st overall pick (^(For reference:  The Raptors) *^(technically)* ^(won the 1996 lottery.  This would have let them draft Allen Iverson but due to those agreements, they were not able to retain said pick; they ended up with the 2nd overall pick and the Philadelphia 76ers were given the 1st overall pick)) but to keep this as simple as possible:  **If the league does expand next year and those expansion teams are in the 2025 draft, the Raptors could drop down 2 spots from where they'll end up pre/post lottery draws - and this is before one factors in a team below them jumping up in the standings**.

Obviously, if the Raptors end up in the Top 4 or if the new teams are placed after the Raptors and Toronto doesn't end up moving down/if the Raptors move down but not lower than where the expansion teams end up (It's complicated) then none of this matters but the addition of expansion teams can lead to some very wonky results in the lottery depending on ""where"" those expansion teams are assigned their pick in the NBA Draft - and if the league decides that the heavily speculated Supersonics and Las Vegas teams or whichever curveball city gets a team are eligible for a chance at drafting Cooper Flagg/Ace Bailey than this gets even more complicated but that scenario is largely unprecedented as far as expansion teams in the draft are concerned.

Since the league is adding 2 teams, we'll look at the Canada expansion in 1995 for a bit of precedent, along with the 2004 draft with the Bobcats due to more significant movement in the lottery results vs. the records of the teams in said lottery.

In the 1995 NBA lottery, the teams selecting from 8-13 had their picks announced without any movement from their pre-draft position.  During the lottery, then-commissioner of the NBA David Stern announced that the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies would be selecting 6th and 7th, however the order would be determined at a later time.

https://preview.redd.it/tv1zvo1e9led1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=68325be9f42262ad9282baaaaf76d0911b99dfb5

The rest of the lottery draw proceeded, with the Golden State Warriors jumping from 5th to 1st, the Philadelphia 76ers jumping up to 3rd from 4th and the Clippers, Bullets (Later renamed the Wizards) and Timberwolves dropping to 2nd, 4th and 5th respectively.

It is worth noting that there a couple of differences between the lottery then and now.  In addition to flattened odds, the NBA now selects the Top 4 picks in the NBA lottery via lottery balls as opposed to just 3 like they did in 1995.  However, there are some observations that we can make from all of this.  While none of the teams below the Raptors/Grizzlies moved up, if one of them did so then whichever team below them would have dropped would be bumped down to 8th.

This actually happened in 2004 where the teams with the worst 4 records in the NBA that season were the Magic, the Bulls, the Wizards and the Clippers.  The expansion Charlotte Bobcats were given the 4th overall pick.  The Wizards and Bulls dropped from their pre-lottery positions; the Bulls went down from 2nd to 3rd and the Wizards dropped to 5th, below the Bobcats despite having the 3rd worst overall record.

With the flattened lottery odds, a scenario this is more likely to happen than ever before; we saw similarly unlikely outcomes in this year's draft where the Atlanta Hawks and Brooklyn Nets (whose pick ended up going to the Rockets as a result of the James Harden trade) jumped up to 1st and 3rd respectively despite having the 9th and 10th best odds of a Top 4 pick in the lottery.  Even the Spurs saw a slight jump up to 4th from 5th overall.

All of this is to say that the 2025 NBA lottery could make for a very wacky outcome if the Raptors do wind up in the lottery once more, depending on where the NBA decides to place these new teams' picks.

Let's use the below scenario to illustrate this, assuming that the new expansion teams will be given the 5th and 6th pick:

* August 2024:  The NBA announces two new expansion teams:  The Seattle Supersonic and the Montreal Muskox
* April 2025:  The Raptors have another poor season and end up with the 6th worst record in the league once more
* As a result of this, the Raptors have the 6th best overall odds in the lottery
* Lottery Day:  The NBA lottery results are in and **3 teams below the Toronto Raptors** jump in to the Top 4
   * As a result of this, the Raptors should drop to 9th overall in a normal draft, however...
   * The league also announces in the middle of the draft that the Supersonics/Muskox will be assigned the 5th/6th pick in the 2025 NBA Draft; the two teams will partake in a coinflip for the 5th pick at a later date
   * As a result, all the teams that did not jump in to the Top 4 will be arranged from worst to best W/L record starting with the 7th overall pick
      * This means that the Raptors will have the 11th pick out of the 16 lottery picks in the 2025 NBA Draft despite having the 6th worst record

If we want to get technical, we would find out that the Raptors dropped to 11th/three teams jumped up in real-time on the day of the lottery i.e. before we find out where the two expansion teams end up, and there would be 16 teams in the lottery as opposed to 14.  Still, the end result is the same:  The Raptors would end up with a lower pick overall as a result of bad lottery luck and the slotting of two new NBA teams.

Now the above is a very unlikely scenario but stranger things have happened in the NBA.  Besides the risk of expanding into the Canadian economy, part of the reason the Raptors and Grizzlies faced several lottery-related restrictions were due to the Orlando Magic, then a new franchise, winning back-to-back #1 overall picks in consecutive drafts, with the 2nd year being one of the lowest overall chances for a team to win the 1st overall pick being amongst the lowest percentages a team has ever won the top pick in NBA history.  This made them a far better team more quickly than anticipated, and it wasn't long before the Magic made their way to their first ever Finals in 1995 against the Houston Rockets.

All of this is to say that this year's draft could have more reason for excitement - and dread - depending on where the lottery balls end up should the Raptors wind up in it once more."
52,Don’t put your phones down. I can’t wait for Masai speech next week,
53,B/R gave us an F. - what they don't know is that F really stands for...?,"Grade: F

Key Additions: Dennis Schröder, Jalen McDaniels, Garrett Temple, Gradey Dick (R)

Key Subtractions: Fred VanVleet, Dalano Banton,

Key Retentions: Gary Trent Jr., Jakob Poeltl

Apparently, losing Fred VanVleet for nothing didn't phase the Toronto Raptors, who seem content to enter this season with Pascal Siakam and O.G. Anunoby ticketed for unrestricted free agency—just like their former teammate. Granted, Anunoby can't extend for more than he's likely to get on the open market. But Raptors GM Masai Ujiri also isn't making it easy to trade either forward for good value by calling them selfish players.

Nick Nurse got the boot and will be replaced by new head coach Darko Rajaković, but it's hard to believe that change will sort out the confusion currently defining this directionless franchise.

Case in point: Toronto gave up a protected first-round pick to acquire Jakob Poeltl last season for reasons that remain unclear, and then it overpaid him on a four-year, $80 million deal this summer. That's the definition of throwing good money after bad.

Had the Raps conducted a fire sale this offseason, this grade would have been higher. Had they locked up Siakam, kept VanVleet and added vets with an intention to win in the short term, this grade would have been higher. Because they failed to choose either path, and because next summer might be even more painful and disjointed than the one we just witnessed, we have to go with a failing grade."
54,The team sucks because of the ownerships,"The [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/18pmbuy/comment/kepom7b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by @Life_of_High about the Raptors have operated as a cheap team got me thinking that it started from the ownerships (I will explain by repeating what I replied to @Life_of_High). And if we follow that analysis, things are about to turn for worse going forward.

tl;dr - Owners no longer interested in winning and the Raptors is stuck at mediocrity forever.

Buying a professional sports team is a very ""weird"" investment. It is one of those highly risky but potentially high return investments. Basically, with investors' typical mentality of ""what profits are you bringing me now"", there's no sensible reason for large corporations like Bell and Rogers to own MLSE based on MLSE' financials. Back then, they bought MLSE for ensuring content for their network/media businesses, and so they had been willing to take some risks as long as the content helped them securing their media customer base. Teams' value appreciations are nice bonus but the value means do little until they sell their stakes.

Other than the intentions of Bell and Rogers, the Raptors' FO has never had completed authority to make trade and contract decisions. Any major trades and contract signing can affect the team's financial performance and the FO must convince the Owners/Board of Directors to approve those moves. This is almost universally true for any NBA team, and so how owners decide matters. Before Bell and Rogers, MLSE was owned by Ontario Teachers Pension Plan for quite a few years - and those years sucked when bean counters have the final say. The golden era of Raptors basketball from 2014-2020 coincided with the ownership change. And the key figure was George A Cope, the former CEO of Bell Canada. He was a basketball player himself and took great interest in the Raptors. The first move included replacing Colangelo with Ujiri.

The Raptors have been a cheap team once George Cope stepped down from being Bell Canada CEO. When Cope was the CEO, as long as Tanenbaum and Cope agreed, Masai could make basketball decisions. Bibic, the current Bell CEO, holds the wallet very tight. Ed Rogers' conflicts with keeping Masai have been widely reported. The dysfunctional team we see is the product of the dysfunctional set up of ownership. It worked when two of the three owners were interested in winning but it fails when two out of three owners are not investing.

After Raptors won the championship but failed to keep the championship core together, there's not much financial incentive for the owners to spend substantially to get another championship. Cope retired, and Ed Rogers interest in only hockey, Raptors is just a cash cow to Bell and Rogers. Milk it as long as they can. Literally the FO stopped doing anything exciting after 2020 other than the 6'9"" experiment, probably they can't convince the cheapo owners to do anything substantial. WNBA is a no go.

Take a look at the shitshow of Leafs' FO last year. Take a look at Tanenbaum's decision to sell his share to someone else instead of Bell and Rogers (when both are entitled to be the first buyers). Tanenbaum is getting old and getting sick of that two. But there's just not many reasons for Bell and Rogers to sell now, and I'm not sure there is any Canadian billionaire who has that much money and interest to buy MLSE outright.

So the team is going down. I suspect trading away Siakam or OG are hard sells to the owners unless they can get some low risk exciting assets in return. That's not likely to happen. Masai and Bobby won't be here for long (and they will build another championship elsewhere with the right owner). And you can bet the next FO will continue to suck. Think the years of Ontario Teachers Pension Plan ownership - it won't be as bad since the viewship would affect Bell/Rogers bottomline but Raptors will be in forever mediocrity."

56,A Speedrunner's Guide to Bruce Brown - And What Can Be Done on Draft Night (Part 1),"The only thing more underwhelming that the Pascal Siakam trade has been the discussion surrounding it, full stop.

While there's certainly a discussion to be had about how the assets they've obtained have been used - the Ochai Agbaji/Kelly Olynyk trade with the Jazz is a homerun given the front office only gave up a bottom 3 pick in a draft executives have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the prospect - the package of Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora, Kira Lewis and 3 firsts - two of which were protected (The Pacers picks are Top 3 and Top 4 protected, though the former will convey at 19th in the 2024 NBA draft) - gave the Raptors neither a prospect one could expect to develop into a starter in the immediate future.  

We all know this, we've all talked about this, it's been done to death and the fact that two of those first rounders came from a draft class *the Raptors felt comfortable trading out of via a lightly protected first-rounder* last season to acquire Jakob Poeltl speaks well enough for the strange sequence of events that culminated in the [exit of a player who expected to be a Raptor for life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEUXb5DIHxQ).

Equally drawn out - but more relevant as the draft fast approaches - has been the discussion of the main piece of salary that came back from Indiana, NBA champion Bruce Brown.

Initially seen as a trade piece to potentially bolster the return one got for Pascal, Brown has been underwhelming as a depth piece and simultaneously was not moved at the trade deadline for the Raptors asking price of a first round pick or a young player.  While the former can be [attributed to a knee injury](https://twitter.com/LindsayDunnTV/status/1779600715536629882), the fact remains that Toronto didn't get what they were hoping for at the deadline and a down year from the supporting player has only served to complicate getting that 1st rounder the Raptors were so adamant to acquire.

Diminished or not, there is value to be had for Bruce Brown, albeit for different reasons than his on-court contributions.  The 2024 free agency class is a weak one, and while there are a few interesting players who could make for interesting bench additions before one has to worry about the cap impact of Scottie's presumed max extension, ultimately there aren't any standouts for upgrading the team's point of needs.  Sure, Jalen Smith would be a nice bench big addition but he's not going to move the needle from play-in territory to surefire playoff seed.

Whether or not his play has affected his value as a contributor to a playoff team's front office, Bruce Brown does have some value as salary relief for a team at or near the first apron - and a few of them just happen to be around the late lottery or have a future 1st to part with.  While Brown alone might not be enough to secure a first rounder, it is possible he could be moved with the Pacers pick to move up in the draft to go after a player the Raptors are interested in (It's been frequently mentioned that Masai was spotted scouting Tidjane Salaun though that doesn't necessarily mean anything; he was also spotted scouting Ismael Kamagate in 2022 yet we went with Christian Koloko) but may not fall to 19.  That's obviously not the same value as getting a 1st but it is useful, and depending on the incoming salary they get in return, they could find themselves a cheap fix for the current roster's many flaws via a ""distressed asset"" a la RJ Barrett; the future point guard and current center positions are locked up but while RJ and Scottie will continue to start, it's up in the air where 2-thru-4 they'll be and who'll take the last position, doubly so with Trent Jr.'s extension is seemingly dead in the water.

In part 1, we'll go over three of the teams that might make for a trade partner to move up from the Raptors current pick situation.

# Chicago Bulls

https://preview.redd.it/g4ppml85krzc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=faf5335b01aeed5379977057b25e708d8a16183a

Most likely player(s)*:  Lonzo Ball*

2021/22 Stats:  *13 points, 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists | 42.3% FG, 42.3% 3P, 75% FT*

Incoming salary:  *$21.3 million (Net of -1.6 million)*

Pick(s) available:  *11th pick in 2024 draft, future 1st from Blazers (Lottery protected thru 2028)*

Quick note before going forward:   While there may be instances where I list multiple picks from a given team, it's altogether unrealistic to expect more than 1 being exchanged unless it's a case where the Raptors are trading down for for two picks in this draft, say, they move from 19th to 22nd and 23rd this year in a similar fashion to what the Grizzlies did in the 2022 NBA draft.  However, given the Raptors already traded the worst of the 2 1st rounders they acquired in this draft, I don't think they'll add another draftee unless someone on their board falls to a position they'd feel comfortable making a deal for.

Anyway, this is perhaps the most obvious suggestion if one operates under the assumption that the Bulls will live up to their namesake with the profound stubbornness and refusal to rebuild they've displayed over the past few years.  Assuming they bring back DeMar, Chicago seems poised to at the very least run it back - if only so they don't give up a valuable pick they owe to the Spurs (Top 10 protected) in 2025 - and they have a very obvious player to attach/dump with their pick.

Unlike other names that will come up, it almost feels pointless to discuss **Lonzo Ball** as a player because he hasn't played in over 2 years.  The once-promising point guard has been on a lengthy recovery timeline and while there's been some talk of him making a return next season, there's zero certainty that the same Ball which had the Bulls as a 1 seed back in 2021/22 will be the one hitting the hardwood.  It's not impossible that he'll return like nothing happened but the most likely scenario is whomever is holding Lonzo's Bird Rights by the 2025 offseason will end up waiving them or buying him out.

With the rise of Coby White - a point guard who, quite frankly, should have won MIP over Maxey - and Ayo Dosunmu improving in his own right as a capable backup point, Chicago has all the reason to rid themselves of Lonzo's not insignificant portion of the team's cap if they plan on making their mandatory play-in appearance.  Brown would give them a depth piece off the bench that can contribute right now while still keeping that alleviation an expiring contract grants their increasingly complicated salary concerns with DeMar poised for a pricey new contract (Ironically, the Bulls trading Lonzo for Brown would increase their payroll by around $1.6 million but I digress).

Heck, if the Bulls try to run it back but find themselves ready to embrace the rebuild they should have at last year's deadline - it isn't altogether difficult for them to meet the requirements to hit on their pick's protections in 2025 - they can likely recoup some value via moving Brown at the 2025 deadline or earlier on the season should they decide to #RaisetheFlagg early.

So yeah, Lonzo and the 11th for Bruce Brown and 19th.

Maybe they expand this into a 3/4 team deal involving Zach Lavine being sent to another team and reroute something to Toronto.

Maybe Toronto turns that 11th pick in to the 2025 first that the Raptors reportedly wanted at the deadline and merely select in the Top 6 (if they keep their pick) and 31st.

Maybe you wrap in a Boucher deal in to this or Chris ends up in Chicago as well.

Maybe you opt for the Blazers future 1st (which is heavily protected until 2028 so...maybe not).

Maybe you try and call the Spurs to see if giving that pick will let them change the protections on Toronto's owed pick (I doubt they give back pick control outright for the 11th pick in this draft).

Point is, there's a lot of options but as far as frameworks/trade partners go, they're a very obvious one and it makes sense for both parties if the Bulls do decide to run it back against all good judgement...the key word being ""if"".

The one complicating factor in all of this is the Bulls might not want nor be able to keep DeMar at the price tag/years he's seeking.  Fit concerns and faux contender status aside, the 76ers are a preferable scenario compared to the Bulls as a playoff team and it's easy to see a world in which Philadelphia adds a new albatross contract to replace Tobias Harris' with via an aging, albeit still very productive on offense, DeMar DeRozan.

With his extension status up in the air, it's entirely possible he'll hit free agency and walk, leaving the Bulls with an absolute nightmare of an offseason to navigate with Zach LaVine likely on the bloc with no one wanting him.

Whether or not LaVine is on the move on draft night in his own right is an open question.  Chicago has a lot of question marks of their own heading in to the draft but the same cannot necessarily be said for the next team...

# Utah Jazz

https://preview.redd.it/10pgl6e8krzc1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3418daf4e620428f032dd3c84e7784eef65a1a7f

Most likely player(s):  *John Collins*

2023/24 Stats:  *15.1 points, 8.5 rebounds, 1.1 assists | 53.2% FG\\37.1% 3P\\79.5% FT*

Incoming salary:  *$26.6 million (Net increase 3.6 million), 3 years | 2 + 1 player option*

Pick(s) available:  *8th pick in 2024 draft (if owned after the 2024 lottery their pick does not drop to 10), 2025 Timberwolves/Cavaliers 1st*

Let me pull out a tin foil cap and offer you a theory:  I think that the Ochai Agbaji/Kelly Olynyk trade started out as a potential John Collins/Bruce Brown swap to get the Mormon state's team to save a bit of money in the short-term & a lot of money in the long-term while simultaneously filling in a backcourt hole the trading of O.G. and Pascal opened up.   Presumably, this began under the goal of getting that 2025 1st Masai and co. were aiming for but whatever the behind the scene specifics, that's not the trade we ended up with.

Owed to Collins having a pretty lengthy contract and him fitting a position of need for the Raptors, albeit with a pretty large asterisk that we'll touch on in a moment, John fit the mold for the buy-low ""distressed asset"" player that Masai Ujiri has sought out such as the aforementioned RJ Barrett acquisition who has seen a paradigm shift in both production and player reputation since playing for the Raptors.

I've talked about Collins before when his name kept cropping up in the 2023 trade rumors at the deadline, as well as when [the Hawks were looking to trade for Pascal Siakam](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/14ibm5c/lets_talk_the_hawks_rumors_but_mostly_john_collins/); at the time, John or fellow frequently rumored Hawks player De'Andre Hunter were seen as the main piece of salary.  If you want a longer explanation then by all means go ahead and read it but the short version is that it was very easy to turn down a deal where Collins was the centerpiece for Pascal, even if John Collins is perfectly capable as an NBA forward.

After being traded to the Jazz for pennies on the dollar and failing to rehab his overall value to be flipped by known fleecer Danny Ainge, Collins name has found his way back in the rumor mill with the Jazz trying to get rid of him, owed [largely to their frustration](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1735451643011854807) with the former Hawks forward.

In a vacuum, John Collins does fill the role of a stretch 4 or a small ball 5...sort of.  The problem is that John Collins, while a decent player overall, is a positionally confusing one on defense.  A great finisher and lob threat on offense, he isn't fast enough to guard most 3s and 4s on defense, and he lacks the size to be a full-time option for a small ball 5 a la the similarly short (Both are 6'9) Bam Adebayo.  His shooting has rebounded from a career-low 29% in his final season with the Hawks (owed largely due to a finger injury that should not be viewed for the faint of heart) to more in line with his career average, Collins days with the Jazz have seen him boasting a 37% 3-point percentage on around 3 attempts per game.

And yet, that optimistic turnaround doesn't extend to the season Collins had overall.  Yes, he's staying close to his career averages for shooting, rebounding, etc. but that's despite greater opportunity being afforded to him.

That is in of itself part of the problem; the Jazz are in a rebuild where, aside from Lauri Markkanen, no one on the team is guaranteed to be part of their future, and even Lauri has had rumors chasing him ever since January.  The door is wide open for anyone to rise up and become a franchise piece, and there's plenty of young talent to give a run for.

It's a prime environment for John Collins to showcase why he was once seen as a rising star like he did in [Atlanta during games where Trae Young was out](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/john-collins-hawks-stats-without-trae-young-2020) and yet...his tenure in Utah has only served to reinforce the notion that John Collins is who he is, and he's not going to improve much from where he is as a player right now.

The player Collins is right now and will be for the duration of his current contract is not a bad one, but they are overpaid relative to their production; Collins is being paid roughly $25 million on average with a player option in the 3rd year of his contract so while he won't be the worst placeholder one could have for a big man, the amount of cap they do take up will require any team that takes on his money to carefully build around the margins under the new CBA.

The other ""trades don't exist in a vacuum"" caveat with a Jollins/Brown swap is that...look, the Raptors want some form of draft capital, whether it's moving up in the draft, picking up a 2nd 1st later in the draft or, preferably, a 1st in the 2025 draft.  The Jazz do have a pick in this draft but it may be a bit too far out of reach to jump up to via a simple salary dump.

Going from 19 to the late lottery a la the above Bulls suggestion or the third team we'll talk about is a viable option if the Raptors are trading Brown to grant a team short or long-term salary relief/turning dead salary into a rotation player. The Mavericks did this very same thing last year when they dumped Davis Bertan contract on to the Thunder while still acquiring the player they originally wanted in Dereck Lively II.  Granted, they only dropped from 10th to 12th but I digress.

Going in to the middle of the lottery from 19 is a significantly higher jump to make.  The Jazz do have an interesting 2nd coming their way via the Wizards and no shortage of future picks from the Timberwolves and the Cavaliers though how heavily protected one of them would be were the Jazz to part ways with said pick, and whether the Raptors would be willing to trade out of this draft's 1st round should they lose their own pick to the Spurs (roughly a 55% chance to occur) is up in the air.

It is worth mentioning that if the Raptors keep their pick at 4 or 6 and expect the player we want to draft in that range to still be on the board by 8th, then perhaps an 6 + Brown for 8 + Collins + a future first from the Wolves/Cavs might be an option.  Otherwise, it's hard to see the Raptors moving up in the first round for this draft via a trade with Utah.

It should also be noted that there is a possibility the Jazz lose their pick to the Thunder, as it's 8th pre-lottery with a Top 10 protection.  If it drops to 11 then it will convey to OKC.

There's one other reason why a trade with Utah is less likely: Recency.  Teams rarely make trades with the same partner in what is effectively the same season and the Jazz have done just that via the frequently mentioned Ochai/Olynyk trade..  Exceptions exist but the fact that the two already did so does make it much less likely that they'll be trade partners in the upcoming draft.

Then again, sometimes trades that died in the offseason or deadline use the previously declined deal as a framework for a deal that does end up happening; the Lakers and Pelicans re-engaged trade talks after failing to acquire Anthony Davis in 2019.  Lo and behold, New Orleans traded away the All-NBA big man for a haul and a half that the Lakers are still on the hook for - and they might still be if the Pelicans defer their owed Lakers pick to 2025.

Speaking of teams with prior trade talks to Toronto...

# Atlanta Hawks

https://preview.redd.it/t4ki5qlhkrzc1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e17febaa7a100d69c6155daacab6324b9e528b14

Most likely player(s):  *De'Andre Hunter*

2023/24 Stats:  *15.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 1.5 assists | 45.9% FG\\38.5% 3P\\84.7% FT*

Incoming salary:  *$21.7 million* *(Net of -$1.3 million for the 1st year)*

Pick(s) available:  *10th pick in 2024 draft, 2025 Kings 1st*

Entering a cap crunch with Okongwu's extension kicking in alongside Dejounte Murray, Atlanta is already poised to make some significant changes in the offseason, with **De'Andre Hunter** and his overall stagnation, in conjunction with Jalen Johnson's rise despite an overall poor season for the Hawks, being a major turning point for the franchise.  

I've talked about Hunter before when the Hawks were heavily rumored to be offering him and draft capital for Pascal Siakam.  Not Kobe Bufkin, who was off-limits per the reports but I digress.  If you want the long version of what was said about De'Andre then you can [give it a read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/16yep6z/the_siakam_to_the_hawks_rumors_have_died_down/).  The short version?  Hunter came in to the 2023/24 season with the reputation of being an average starter on an okay, albeit slightly overpaid given current production, contract and thus he seemed like potential insurance in the off-chance O.G. Anunoby left or someone to flip to another team.

Lo and behold, the Raptors eliminated that possibility of him walking by trading O.G. in the thus far Quickley/Barrett 1-2 punch knockout of a trade, leaving the team with newfound optimism - and a massive hole in their wing/forward rotation so Hunter seems like a perfect buy-low candidate, right?

Well, let's talk about how bad of a season Hunter had and why he left the 2023/24 season with the reputation of having the worst contract on the Hawks roster.  Whatever else you can say about Collins, he's off the books in 2026, 2025 if he declines his player option. Hunter is there until 2027 with no chances of an inflated ego causing him to enter early in to free agency.

To start, part of the reason that the reception for Hunter's extension was so mixed was a lack of progress on either end of the floor since the 2022 playoff series between the Hawks and the Heat that earned him so significant a payday.  In it, De'Andre flashed signs of the two-way wing he could be; he shot 46% on 5 3s a game and played solid defense throughout the 5 game series.  The Kawhi comparisons were overblown but reaching the level of, say, a Mikal Bridges where they're a solid connecting piece who can start on a playoff team seemed like a viable outcome.

This version of Hunter has not appeared since.  How much one wants to blame injury on his lack of progress - he's missed a lot of games due to various injuries - the fact of the matter is his limited offensive game hasn't developed whatsoever, his defensive effort lacks consistency and worst of all, his 2023 offseason revealed that he ""[hadn't worked on anything](https://packaged-media.redd.it/7nsavm95evrb1/pb/m2-res_630p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&v=1&e=1715328000&s=430a9dead5ed48ec50d7c922396b1cb6fb105aaf#t=0)"". 

Admittedly that last one was him trying to joke but it was a joke that reflected the altogether underwhelming tenure that was their latest season where, yet again, Hunter failed to show any signs of improvement while the far less experienced Jalen Johnson flourished.  He's the Deandre Ayton of wings; a physically gifted player physically but with a low motor to improve their game or in general play with a consistent level of energy.  A change of scenery can do wonders for a player but unlike the aforementioned Ayton, Hunter's ceiling is significantly lower and with an extra year on his contract that makes them similarly expensive for a pseudo starter like Hunter.

Whereas Lonzo is more or less filler to make the deal work and John Collins is an actual NBA player on a bad deal, Hunter is decidedly more frustrating.  They're a positional fit on paper but in execution, they're a quietly poor contract for a player that has disappointed year after year.  It's no exaggeration to say that De'Andre's mundane performance since his extension is a notable reason why the Hawks have struggled in recent years.

Speaking of Atlanta, the Hawks are in an odd position regarding salary relief, for two reasons.  

One is that their own pick, currently 10th in the draft, might be more valued internally by the Hawks than an opportunity to rid themselves of Hunter's albatross of a contract, as this will be the last first round pick they stand to control for several years due to the disastrous Dejounte trade.  While there isn't an obvious player in their range to fix their many roster issues, young talent for a team that may be contemplating trading Trae Young is young talent to keep around in this hypothetical rebuild around Jalen Johnson.

So yeah, the Hawks might not be planning to move their pick on draft night.  Atlanta does have a very early 2nd from the Blazers (34th overall) and a protected pick from the Kings that has since been deferred to 2025.  The protections on said pick have gone from lottery protected to Top 12 (Top 10 if it doesn't convey in 2025) so it's not as though there isn't an opportunity to acquire future draft capital and that second could make for an interesting option to trade out in to the 2nd round of next year's trade as Toronto lacks any picks for the 2025 draft if their own defers.  

Depending on what Sacramento does - or doesn't do - and with the West being the bloodbath it was this season, it might be preferable to bet against Sacramento for reasons we'll cover in Part 2 (Spoilers:  It'll be framed around Huerter who's been terrible ever since the Kings playoff appearance) though by that same logic, the Hawks may prefer holding on to that first-rounder due its potential value in the 2025 draft though how much better next year's draft will be outside of the top-end talent is too early to say.

The other factor is that while they are an over-the-tax team looking at the luxury tax in the 2025 season with Jalen Johnson breaking out at just the right time to demand a hefty extension, Atlanta has a massive trade exception from the John Collins trade that they can also use to take on a bad contract or potentially make use of the Kings 2025 1st they own to bring in more help around Young and whomever they trade Murray for in the scenario where they try to build around Trae instead of kicking off a rebuild.

Will they do that?  It's hard to say.  Unlike the Bulls who should be rebuilding but are likely running it back after they find LaVine a new team, the Hawks aren't in a position to rebuild due to the Spurs having their picks/pick control for the next few years so they aren't incentivized to be a bad team.  Most of the time, trade exceptions don't get used (See:  The massive trade exception the Raptors generated for sign and trading Chris Bosh) so it wouldn't be a surprise if that same thing happens to the Collins expectation.

On the other hand, it's equally difficult to see them getting a player good enough to lift them out of the ditch they're stuck in - for those wondering Bruce Brown's exception does fit in neatly for said exception and a Hunter/Brown trade would  create a new trade exception for Atlanta - and thus avenues for trading what few assets Atlanta may be willing to part with become a lot less appealing.   

That getting rid of Hunter's contract by moving down a few spots in the lottery is seen as a positive outcome for their draft day moves should speak volumes about how unenviable a position the Hawks are in.  Little room for internal improvement and even less options to retool their roster, low optimism due to a potential cap crunch and no pick control until 2028.

But hey, it was worth keeping Kobe Bufkin over trading him for Siakam, right Atlanta?

# Conclusion

For those that want a TL;DR for the first 3 teams, see the below chart:

|*Team*|*Player(s)*|Years left on contract|*Pick(s) \[Assuming position stays if in the lottery\]*|*Incoming salary (2024)*|*Net salary  added to the Raptors (2024)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Chicago Bulls**|Lonzo Ball|1; player option in 2024/25|11th, 2025 Blazers 1st|$21.3 million|-1.6$ million|
|**Atlanta Hawks**|De'Andre Hunter|3|10th, 2025 Kings 1st|$21.7 million|-$1.3 million|
|**Utah Jazz**|John Collins|2;  player option in 2025/26|8th (Only an option if we keep our 1st), 2025 Timberwolves/Cavaliers 1st|$26.6 million|+$3.6 million|

There are more teams to talk about that we'll add to the chart but I think it's best to wait and see who lands where in the lottery - and whether we'll keep our pick or not - before we continue.

That's all for now.  Until next time, game on my friends."
57,A Speedrunner's Guide to the 2023/24 Toronto Raptors Trade Deadline: Trade Targets,"No introduction since we're character limited, let's get started.

**Pick N' Swaps**

Right, let's get the boring one out of the way.  Part of the ongoing lawsuit between the Knicks & Raptors is over a series of ""stolen documents"" & if there's anything that the Raptors resemble the Knicks - besides their players - it's in the accumulation of draft assets.  The Raptors aren't as pick heavy as one might think, notably due to lacking any second round picks - that 2019 championship team's bill is almost fully paid but the 2023 2nd traded to the Grizzlies (now owned by the Mavericks if i'm recalling where it's ended up) is still owed for Marc Gasol - &  they lack pick control of their own.  So it makes sense that they are seemingly in the midst of collecting young players on rookie deals & the next best thing via draft picks.  Notably, they managed to nab 3 first rounders for Siakam & are seeking a 4th for Bruce Brown.  Additionally, they grabbed a Detroit second that is likely to end up as the best pick on the second night of the draft.

In terms of quantity that's not nothing but as far as the quality of the picks the Raptors are likely to own - barring a combination of a monumental collapse by the Pacers & the lottery balls launching their pick to 4th - the acquired ones aren't highly valuable.  That OKC/Clippers pick in particular...it isn't going to be great.  Salary-wise it might be decent since a late first is a low cap hit & thus can allow but strictly in terms of where it falls in this draft, it doesn't give you a high level of choice for the player(s) one can select & this draft is notably weak; it's frequently compared to the 2000 NBA Draft which is in the running for worst NBA draft of all time.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkmyucpjagc1.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1dc9414c89c313974c958cc1322c7f9ead888f

This isn't the worst thing in the world given the Raptors have 2 - possibly 3 if they keep their own  that's currently owed to the Spurs - firsts to use in this draft in addition to that aforementioned highly valuable second rounder from Detroit.  However, the least valuable of OKC's multitude of firsts isn't going to be all that good of a pick on its own, hence looking for a right to swap picks.

Why a pick over a swap? Well, there's a couple of reasons.  For one, the 2024 draft in particular is highly concentrated amongst a few teams, namely the Spurs/OKC/Rockets/Knicks so that limits the number of trade partners one has for, say, a Bruce Brown or Dennis Schroder trade, irrespective of whether one of them or another player would be considered worth swapping picks.  For another, a lot of those teams who do own their pick in 2024 - or in the Lakers case, might own their pick once they know whether the Pelicans will exercise their right to their 2024 1st or defer the obligated first to 2025 - can't directly trade it due to prior commitments i.e. the Suns can't trade their 2024 1st due to the Kevin Durant trade, the Mavericks can't trade their 2025 1st due to Tingus Pingus' trade from years ago, etc.

A lot of these teams can, however, offer to swap picks, & while that is significantly less valuable than directly acquiring their draft capital, it can allow a crafty GM to move up in the draft to acquire a player.A recent example of this would be the Rockets, who traded Eric Gordon for a pick swap (fore reference, the asking price originally was a first for Eric Gordon) that allowed Houston to exchange their Bucks 2023 1st for the Clippers own first which in turn let them move up a whopping 10 spots (!) in the draft.  Granted, the 2023 NBA draft looks to be an historic one while 2024's is up in the air if there's any player, let alone players, who will become a franchise-altering star of any sort.

Of course, the Raptors don't need to get another pick or swap in this draft & there is always the possibility of stocking up on 2025 or 2026 capital to either let Toronto draft a young player in a draft they feel much stronger about or defer their draft capital usage until they can package them together to acquire a star player that pushes them closer to contention.

That brings up the the more tangible portion of this discussion.  While the current asking price of Bruce Brown is ""1 first and a 'good player'"", there isn't any reason to suggest that Toronto can't nor won't accumulate more picks/swap through trading any of their other, non-core pieces...and they have a pretty obvious means of doing so too.

**Bad (to the bone) Contracts**

The types of trades Toronto can make are easy to break down in to two categories:

* Trading their expiring for bad contracts + good players/picks
* Trading their expiring or bench players who have value on their own (Trent Jr., Schroder, etc.) & potentially include draft capital to acquire decent players/potential expiring contracts that come with draft capital.  We'll be focusing on the former while saving the latter for a different post.

Between Young, Trent Jr. & Porter's combined $32.8 million expirings before including Boucher or Schroder's own addable salary & Bruce Brown being a $22 million expiring that can't be combined with the latter players, there's an opportunity for the Raptors to take on a bad contract or three that comes with a good player(s) and/or draft capital.  It's not a likely strategy - the Raptors in recent years have prioritized financial flexibility & given Scottie's extension is coming soon they may continue to prioritize that - but given the weakness of the 2024 free agency class - a class where two former Raptors are perhaps the most enticing free agents on the market and both are equally unlikely to return - it may be preferable to take on long-term money to bolster their assets and take a stab at free agency in a stronger class such as 2025 or 2026.  It's not like the Raptors have, historically, been a major player in free agency even when it comes to courting roleplayers, to say nothing of how what few notable players like Hedo or Carroll panned out, but I digress.

There is one hitch in the ""bad contacts"" plan; there aren't a ton of overtly atrocious contracts on the books right now.  To be sure, they do exist but the ones that do should not be expected to be on the move i.e. the Wizards are probably not moving Jordan Poole who holds arguably the worst contract in the league right now & the Blazers aren't likely to give up so soon on Deandre Ayton despite a disappointing debut in Portland.

Likewise, Gobert or Dame's respective contracts might age poorly but it doesn't matter when their teams are in contention or hold the 1st seed in their respective contracts.

That said, there are a few names to note & the teams that boast them could make for mutual trade partners given where they are & what they need.  Some of them have circumstantial factors that make them less likely but none of them should be outright discounted.

Let's get started.

**Ben Simmons**

Yes he had a good game recently - good by current Ben's standards anyway - but let's not forget how long Ben Simmons has been out.

Or the player he's been ever since the infamous Game 7 against the Hawks.

Or how much he's being paid.

Besides Jordan Poole, Simmons is arguably the worst contract when one considers his production vs. how much he's being paid.  Ben might be a more productive player than Poole but between that production coming with a salary that's going to demand a whopping $40 million in 2024/25 and the astounding amount of games Ben has missed due to back injuries, among other injuries since becoming a Net (i.e. not even accounting for injuries he suffered as a 76er or even in college), not to mention Ben's well-known issues on offense and regression on his defense, it's no surprise teams aren't lining up to acquire the former All-NBA, All-Star, All-Defense 6'10 PG.  The chances he even comes close to those heights are microscopic and the contract he's coming with makes that a thoroughly unappealing risk when there's so little chance of a reward.

The one benefit Ben does has compared to Poole, beyond being a better player when he does play (which isn't saying much, Jordan Poole is a contender for worst player in the league right now if one delves in to the advanced stats), his contract is only on the books for another season after this one.  It's a lot of money to take on for said season since $40 million equates to roughly 28% of the cap for that year and said salary is going towards a player who's suited up less than 50 games over the last 3 seasons, but between the aforementioned weakness of the 2024 free agency class, a much stronger free agency class in 2025 and the players/picks Brooklyn could attach to dump Ben's contract, it's easy to talk one's self in to renting out said cap space for the young socialite to spend sometime in the 6ix if they're not confident they can sign...Jalen Smith or Nic Claxton?

As for who could be included, the aforementioned *Nic Claxton* has popped up in trade rumors & with him being a flight risk due to him being an expiring, it's not impossible to see him on the move.  Claxton is a good center.  Switchable on defense & a superb shot blocker, he might not fit the role of a stretch 5 given how few 3 points he takes but his defensive impact is worth a potential flight risk...albeit said risk does come with caveat.

Besides his free throw shooting percentages resembling Jakob's, Claxton is a difficult fit next to Poeltl & thus necessitates moving on from him, be it at the deadline or on draft night if the plan is for Claxton to be the team's center of the future and all the potential problems with fitting next to Scottie due to Nic's lack of a bag.  He's also a significantly worse passer so one shouldn't expect to operate with Claxton at the top of the key like Poeltl can.

Having said all of that, Claxton's availability may be overstated & the risk of him walking is very real given the aforementioned menial free agency class.  Arguably, he's the best available roleplayer that one could see moving teams given O.G.'s expected commitment to the Knicks that led to him being traded.  It's certainly not unfair to say he is the best center on the market; he's likely to command a heftier contract than what Jakob Poeltl earned.

This isn't to say Nic is even the most likely player to pair with Ben as the Nets have two lengthy wings that haven't see much playtime despite the odd spot that Brooklyn finds themselves in.  Both 2023 rookies, both relatively unproven 19 year-old wings, each drafted as polar opposites in terms of strengths.  Noah Clowney was notable for his offensive upside as a 6'10 forward who showed a ton of promise on defense while Dariq Whitehead's defensive potential is just that; his scoring is far more developed. Between the two, Whitehead is a lot less appealing, having suffered from injuries in college & already requiring a surgery that is expected to end his rookie season with a mere 2 games to his name.  Not to say that Clowney has played that much more - he's only hit the hardwood 3 games despite being available for more games than Dariq - but the Raptors are far more in need of size and defense than they are lacking in scoring threats.

As far as draft picks go, Brooklyn has several firsts from the Suns - all of which are protected - and there is a 2029 Dallas 1st which could be valuable depending on what happens with Luka in this postseason, assuming the Mavericks even make it that far as they're stuck in the play-in.  They also have access to some very distant firsts of their own but given their current predicament, it's unlikely they'd be willing to go for much longer without control of their own picks after the Harden trade backfired in spectacular fashion, not to mention the infamous trade made with the Celtics back in 2013.

It's hard to say what the Nets in general will do at this year's deadline.  They are in a weird spot where they can't tank due to lacking control over their own picks but have a slew of draft capital they could move either for a star or to retool their roster and keep them afloat so as to not give the Rockets a series of valuable lottery draft picks as Houston moves towards being a playoff team due to their own pick situation.  If they are planning to make a move, Ben's contract can be used to fill out the roster with roleplayers who can keep them from being in the NBA's basement.

*TL;DR - The young socialite's contract is bad but only goes on for 2 seasons.  Money is money though, and Ben is making a lot. The Nets can make renting out cap space for Ben's contract sting a lot less with the package they can create while the Raptors await to retool their bench in the 2025 offseason.*

**Andrew Wiggins**

Something something Canadian.  Now that we've gotten out of the way, let's talk about All-NBA Bad Contract 1st Team Andy.

Wiggins is notorious for his chronic underachieving in Minnesota, notably being one of the reasons Jimmy Butler forced his way off of the Timberwolves in 2018.  It's part of how Andrew wound up in Golden State, being moved in a salary dump for D-Lo and the pick that became the Kum Bucket (Yes that's Johnathan's real nickname).

In Dub territory, Wiggins managed to turn his career around and while he may not have played well enough to be an All-Star starter, he was certainly playing like an All-Star.  He was a key contributor to the Warriors 2022 title run and was indisputably the second-best player on the team that beat the Celtics in 6 games...

...and then the 2022/23 season happened.  While Draymond Green's infamous assault on Jordan Poole is pointed to as the turning point for the Warriors season - and it was - the prolonged absence of Wiggins hurt a Warriors team that lost a significant amount of depth in the offseason and while they did end up making the playoffs, it was in spite of Wiggins only playing 37 games who did not look particularly good at that...

...and then the most recent season happened.  It's a bit hyperbolic to say this is Wiggins worst season overall as i've heard many say but relative to expectations i.e. him being in his 9th year and making an All-Star appearance (regardless of whether it was due to K-pop stans) it is his most disappointing.  His shooting has regressed, his defense has regressed and in general he doesn't look like the same player he was 2-3 seasons ago.  There's been a lot of speculation as to why but the fact of the matter is that, after getting a notable extension that is easily the longest of any on this list at $109 million over 4 years - 3 not counting this current season - Wiggins has been an enormous disappointment for one and a half seasons with a notable chunk of change to his name for three more seasons - two if he turns things around since the third year is a player option but if he doesn't then one is looking at a trio of woeful Wiggins seasons.

All of this is to say, Andrew Wiggins is a frustrating player.  He always been gifted as a two-way wing but questions about his motor/general effort dated back to his college days. The fact he's regressing this much despite being only 28 years old is only further evidence of that.

As far as any sort of salary dump goes, Golden State isn't exactly heavy on the draft capital - they can only move one pick way down the line in 2028 due to a previously traded pick to the Grizzlies (now owned by the Blazers) that they're definitely not removing the protections on, light as they may be; it's Top 4 and with the Warriors being in the play-in race, it would be a baffling decision to pull off such a move barring a homerun trade or two that puts them back in to the playoff race in a bloodbath of a Western Conference.  They could swap a pick or two any years between 2027 and 2029 instead but the aging core of the Warriors makes moving any sort of draft capital a highly risky endeavor.  Thus, said swap(s) are likely to be heavy on the protections, as is likely the case with the Warriors were they to move their 2028 pick.

To be blunt, a single first or a swap or two with heavy protections seems inadequate given just how long Wiggins contract will go on for.  If Andrew can bounce back (more on that later) then it's a terrific buy-low opportunity but as far as the value he currently brings, the answer is none.

That brings us to the young players.  Or rather the one young player they might be amiable to moving.

While Kuminga is unlikely to be moved and Podziemski is equally likely to be left untouched given he's the only young Warrior who's been given some leeway with Kerr's questionable coaching decisions, the Warriors have been seemingly less attached to *Moses Moody*; referring back to Steve Kerr, he bench the third year Warrior in a game where he went 4/4 from the field in the 4th quarter's opening minutes and was rewarded by being benched and watching Golden State blow the lead he helped to create in a loss against the Kings.

Moody was the Warriors selection with their own pick in the 2021 draft and while he's no Sengun, who was available with the 14th pick, Moses has become a quality roleplayer of a shooting guard despite the lack of opportunity afforded to him.  He's shown flashes of his defensive potential and while his shooting percentage does come with the asterisk of playing next to the greatest shooter of all time in Steph Curry, there's nothing about his form to suggest he's incapable of continuing to shoot a respectable 36% from 3, especially with some of the good looks that, in theory, Scottie could be able to get Moody as well as his teammates under the similarly pass-happy 0.5 offense system Darko has been successfully employing despite the recent assist streak being broken.

Lastly, it should be acknowledged that while I don't have much faith in Wiggins rebounding from his last two mediocre seasons, he has the highest possibility of salvaging his value and, if nothing else he does fit a positional need on this team.  Given how long Andrew is under contract for, it's not as though one will be free of him if he doesn't turn his career around in a season or two so there is a lot of risk that this move will backfire.

His age makes him far from ideal for a fit next to Scottie and being a career 35.5% 3-point shooter isn't altogether impressive - especially when his few notably decent seasons have been in Golden State where one has to worry about Steph Curry more than Wiggins - but he can function as a placeholder as the Raptors restore their forward rotation after trading away O.G. and Siakam, not to mention how depleted it will be if Boucher is gone by the deadline.

*TL;DR - Wiggins is a positional fit but his long contract and current play makes him a hard sell with the Warriors lacking assets to dump his contract.*

**John Collins**

For the other ""buy low"" wing option, we have John Collins, a player that Danny Ainge bought low on in the hopes of flipping him at the deadline that has backfired to the extent that John might be one of the few trades Danny has lost on given the former Hawks forward has not rebounded to his 2020/21 form.

Like Simmons, John is not a bad player but while he would fill in the wide gap that is the team's forward rotation, he is overpaid for what he brings to the table and unlike Ben who is only on the books for this and the next season, John's final year on the books (2025/26) includes a player option he is almost certain to pick up and thus his $25.3 AAV contract is essentially there to stay for 3 years, counting the remaining season for one of those three years.  There is a possibility his value could rebound but as of right now, he's a negative asset making a not insignificant amount of money; he's the Jazz's highest paid player right now and he's arguably their 6th best player, depending on how one feels about Kelly Olynyk.  He's undersized to guard opposing centers but his skillset best suits him at the 5 instead of the 4.  He's improved defensively in the past two seasons but his offense remains limited.

As far as compensation for Collins' contract, the Jazz have a significant stash of draft picks they can part with, namely unprotected firsts from Cleveland or Minnesota; they aren't likely to part with any of their young talent due to them being in the midst of a rebuild with the only notable exception being the currently floundering *Talen Horton-Tucker.  That said,* THT is himself making a not insignificant $11 million & thus is hard to truly consider a centerpiece of a Collins salary dump.  Plus, it's an open question as to whether the Raptors front office still have any interest after the past two seasons of terrible THT play in the Mormon state.

There is one notable obstacle to any sort of salary dump for John Collins.  That would be the aforementioned GM of the Jazz, Danny Ainge.  There are a few teams and/or GMs the Raptors and/or Masai Ujiri/Bobby Webster have never traded with & Ainge fits the latter for Masai/Ainge.  Not only that but Ainge is notoriously stingy when it comes to trading draft picks; like Masai Ujiri he has never traded more than one first round pick in a single transaction though it should bear mentioning that Collins contract likely won't require more than that as compensation.

As interesting as either one of Utah's two movable 2025 picks may be due to their respective team's unique circumstances i.e. Mitchell being unlikely to re-sign with Cleveland & the Timberwolves tax woes-to-be making it likely they will have to make trades in the near future, the Raptors being more likely to prefer players over picks does make a move with the Jazz far less likely than some of the other names on this list.  Additionally, Utah's team is in a bit of a weird state where they could be buyers or sellers at the deadline given how good they've been of late and how valuable some of their roleplayers may be to a contender.

*TL;DR - John Collins is a standard bad contract for an okay player on a team that might not be incentivized to move him...yet.*

**Davis Bertans (Sort of)**

Unlike the previous two examples, Bertans isn't really worth noting as a player even if the former two weren't exactly great to begin with.  He's a non-shooter who got paid to shoot in Washington, he doesn't bring anything useful as a player & while he is overpaid, he functions as a semi-expiring as there is an early termination option that comes with a $5.3 million guarantee.

For both the Thunder and any team that involves Davis as a trade piece, what can be included with him is more of note than Bertans himself because said team still has to a) either waive or buyout Bertans and b) either option will include paying the 2024/25 guarantee.

For draft capital, take your pick.  Literally.  Whether it's one of their 4 2024 firsts with varying protections and quality, their tetra of 2025 firsts and no shortage of swaps or picks from L.A., not to mention a slew of seconds that could be highly valuable from aging cores currently in contention, there is no shortage to attach to Davis' contract.  It is dubious that they would be willing to attach one of the more valuable picks, however, given how lightly protected the Rockets 2024 first rounder is, and barring a collapse from the 76ers their 2025 1st isn't likely to be all that valuable.

With the number of picks & guaranteed salary the Thunder have along with the general roster crunch they experienced over the summer, they are more likely to move some of their current draft stash, albeit they may choose to defer their draft choices by moving their current selections in to a later draft a la moving a 2023 1st to acquire a 2029 Nuggets first rounder that is far more likely to be of value than the one they gave up.

As far as young players go, the most obvious name is *Ousmane Dieng*.  Unlike the Jazz who are in the midst of a rebuild, the Thunder may be more willing to part with one of their young players, namely due to Bertans being the only notable piece of salary filler they have on their relatively inexpensive roster to upgrade their team, & Dieng is the obvious non-draft pick Oklahoma could include given his place in the rotation has been suspect unlike other rookies/sophomores such as Jaylin Williams or Cason Wallace, neither of whom are likely to be available.

Dieng is an interesting player.  I wouldn't call him good - he's fallen out of the Thunder's rotation for reasons we'll get in to -  having only played 22 games off the bench this season, and in fewer minutes than he did in his rookie season.  That said, he has an interesting combination of size & skill as a forward.  At 6'10 with an enormous 7' wingspan and a surpassingly fluid handle for said size, the former 11th pick in the 2022 NBA draft has a lot of potential as a two-way wing, & at 20 years of age he has plenty of time to make - and learn - from his mistakes to reach his ceiling.

The key word is potential.  Ousmane has a bad habit of shirking from contact & despite his incredible size & fluidity, he lacks aggression on defense; this is part of why he has a paltry 7 blocks to his lengthy limbs, not even coming close to an average of once per game with 0.4 blocks per game in his rookie season.  Did I mention he's yet to get a single block in his sophomore season?

He also has a habit of losing track of his man but that's unrelated to the lack of blocking or stealing even when given a leash.  The other issue with Dieng is the complete lack of outside shooting.  This was a problem dating back to his draft days & while he's seen a slight uptick in his 3-point shooting in both the G-League and NBA proper, going 30% on less than 1 attempt per game is uninspiring, to say the least.  Their shot form isn't broken or anything, he's just not making his 3-pointers which, again, is why he's more likely to be on the move than the hot-handed rookie Cason Wallace.

Still, Dieng does have one major point in his favor:  For his size, he's an excellent passer that, although the assists may not jump out at first, could thrive in an offense than benefits from smart players who need to make quick decisions on the fly such as the 0.5 offense the Raptors are utilizing.  A 6'10 playmaking wing is a valuable archetype on its own.  The fact that Dieng can be all that & more if given a proper runway makes him one of the few young forwards that could fit in to a Raptors retool around BBQ if made available in a trade.

*TL;DR - Bertans is the choose your own adventure novel equivalent of trade pieces.  There is a deal to be made & he doesn't eviscerate a team's future flexibility but his ETO is a penalty all the same.*

**Richaun Holmes (Also sort of...but not really...but worth ment-look we'll get in to it momentarily)**

Fun fact:  Holmes was one of the centers we were rumored to be interested in during the last season the Raptors had any notable cap space (2021, aka. post-Tampa).  Regardless of how negotiations fell apart, the lack of signing seems like a blessing in disguise as unfortunate injury after unfortunate injury & an ugly custody dispute that involved allegations of child abuse & domestic violence from his ex-wife that we don't have a ton of time to delve in to have made Holmes a player wholly lacking in trade value.  Needless to say it's not a surprise why Sacramento dumped him on the Mavericks in the 2023 draft.

Here's the problem with picking Holmes as your bad contract trade target:  Even if one sets aside what one chooses to believe regarding the allegations (said allegations resulting in a defamation lawsuit against the outlet that first reported on them & the court ruling in favor of Holmes for custody are not evidence in of itself of no wrongdoing on his part, but in terms of overall evidence, we aren't privy to the finer details of said allegations unlike, say, the very well known & public evidence of Miles ""man who should absolutely be in jail & out of the league"" Bridges &  thus have only word of mouth to rely on; at the risk of derailing this section, I will say I believe the allegations are true but with the custody dispute over & no investigation into said allegations of abuse following the now settled lawsuit, we aren't likely to find out the specifics), it needs to be noted that the Mavericks are very unlikely to want to give up any of their young players or their sole movable first-rounder in any deal at this year's deadline - & that's just about the only way to convince any team to add the backup to Dwight Powell & a rookie Lively to their roster.

One needs to understand that Dallas needs to simply wait until the offseason before they have far more flexibility in shoring up their team:  If the Mavericks currently owed 2024 1st conveys to the Knicks in this year's draft (Top 10 protected), that gives them 3 first-round picks they can attach to Holmes' and/or another player(s) salary, & it is worth noting Richaun is an expiring deal in the 2024/25 season with a player option he's absolutely going to take.  Dallas might not have a prime package to get another star next to Luka when their best young player \[who is available; Dereck Lively is more or less untouchable at this point\] but they could use their combination of newly freed up draft capital, contracts & young wings in *Josh Green* & *Olivier-Maxence Prospe*r to bolster up the roster with quality roleplayers rather than risk Luka's dissatisfaction leading to a trade request.

Much like Utah's Ainge's lack of trade history with Bobby & Masai doesn't preclude the possibility of a trade between the two, there isn't anything to fully eliminate the potential of a panic trade.  Between the [looming fear of Luka wanting out of Dallas](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-luka-doncic-trade-request-rumor-fear-mark-cuban) & the team currently in the play-in race, they may have to make moves with what they have.  What they have right now isn't nothing but much like when they were up for consideration as a Siakam trade partner, they don't have the most appealing of packages.

Right off the bat, the sole first rounder they have access to in 2027 is hard to see them parting with given the aforementioned possibility of Luka wanting out, at least not with some notable protections.  The Mavericks do have potentially useful seconds in the Raptors own 2024 2nd & a Miami 2nd in 2028, but beyond that, their draft capital is sparse for the moment.

Though their young players aren't the most exciting names, they do have some potentially decent fits next to Barnes.  *Jaden Hardy* is suffering from a sophomore slump - down from a hot 40% from 3 to 35.5% on less than one more attempt per game compared to his rookie season & in general less efficient from the field compared to last year - but he's equal parts affordable an option at the 2 if one is planning on moving Gary Trent Jr. & handles the rock decently as a tertiary ballhandler off the bench.  His defense is unimpressive, however & on a team whose defense has fallen off of a cliff, he's not the most ideal roster addition.

Speaking of slump, the recently extended *Josh Green* is not having the best season following said payday.  While his 3-point shooting has quietly climbed back up to around what he shot last year, his general offense outside of taking & making 3s needs work & his defense, once a strong point of his, has also boarded the S.S. Regress & unlike his 3-pointer, his defense has not come anywhere near close to where it was a season ago.  It's by no means atrocious - he's still a better defender than Jaden Hardy but it's not unfair to say that Josh has failed to follow through on his proclamations of stepping up for the Mavs defensively.

While Hardy & Green are known entities, the 2023 rookie that Sacramento gave to Dallas when dumping, Olivier-Maxence Prosper is all question marks.  O-Max was drafted for all the sort of qualities that the Raptors are known to love.  He's a lengthy forward with versatility on defense but underdeveloped offensive capabilities.  Prosper did shoot well from the line in two of his three college seasons - 82% & 73.5% in 2021/22 & 2022/23 respectively - but how well that will translate to the NBA or his skillset in general is hard to say; the 2023 rookie has played less than 10 minutes per game across 25 games & this include a stretch where the Mavericks were both banged up & in need of someone stepping up to keep their season afloat.

It's hard to read too much in to what little he's played in Dallas as even the far more promising Dereck Lively has had his struggle with playtime due to Jason Kidd's notoriously inflexible rotations that prioritize playing their veterans over any promising young talent on the team.  It is worth noting that Prosper is one of the few known players that had a workout with the Raptors but how much interest they have in him at the moment isn't known.  It certainly wasn't enough for them to make a move on draft night to acquire him but who knows what deals, if any, fell through or if the Mavericks managed to nab him before a deal with another team was meant to be pulled off.

Regardless of who one might be interested in, none of them are intriguing enough to consider them a steal if one manages to get any one of the three - & it's only one of them, there is no world in which the Mavericks part way with any more than that, if only because the Raptors are already strapped for roster slots without waving players - along with Holmes who'll more likely than not resume his benchwarming duties that he assumed in Dallas.

*TL;DR - Richaun Holmes is an option for a salary dump in theory but in practice Dallas may opt to make moves in the offseason & they don't have the most appealing players/picks to include in any deal.*

**Killian Hayes**

So as said, there aren't a lot of obvious examples for a salary dump.  A season or two ago, Fournier & Bertans were the go-to guy but it's gotten to the point where calling one of the few examples, that being calling Killian's final year of his rookie contract bad, is a stretch.  He's essentially an expiring & while he could be made an RFA, there is neither an obligation nor justification to extend Hayes a qualifying offer.

As bad as Killian has been overall, he's both young & not without his points of redemption.  Notably, he's a decent defender & can handle the ball acceptably as a 2nd or 3rd string guard in the rotation.  As a primary/secondary ballhandler in one's starting rotations?  One only has to look at Detroit's current record to see how that has gone.

That being said...$7.4 million is a still a lot of money for a borderline NBA player one would be taking a flier on, especially when the Raptors have another reclamation project in Kira Lewis Jr. & while any team picking up Killian isn't going to foot the entire bill for his salary, they do have to pay a not unsubstantial amount for a player who is likely to be out of the league come next season.  The Pistons don't have a ton of draft capital to spare outside of a useful second rounder from Washington that is going to fall somewhere in the top 3 of the 2nd night of this year's draft but again, with Hayes' status as a salary dump candidate being questionable, it's hard to see Detroit including anything of note; even said valuable second rounder might be pushing it given the Spurs are allegedly interested in the distressed asset of a PG that is Hayes.

The one interesting thing to note about Killian is that his salary would fit in nicely to the Raptors $10 million-ish trade exception & could potentially be used as a part of a larger trade to open up another trade exception in a similar manner to the O.G. trade exception opening up said $10 million exception as part of the Toronto Raptors.

*TL:DR - It's Killian Hayes, I refuse to elaborate.  Emphasizing the L in TL;DR.*

**Conclusion**

There you have it.  With the Raptors prioritizing flexibility in what looks like a weak free agency class, the possibility of them taking on any of these players isn't altogether likely but it shouldn't be a surprise if they decide to make use of their many expiring contracts in about a week's time.

Whether that's to take on bad money or make marginal moves to shore up the roster with what assets they do have remains to be seen.  As for who could possibly be up for consideration for the latter, we'll touch on that next time."

# Raptors below:

> **State of the roster**: For the third time in four years, Toronto enters the offseason out of the playoffs. The foundation of Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam no longer is on the roster. Anunoby and Siakam were replaced with Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett, Kelly Olynyk, Ochai Agbaji and future draft picks. 

> The Raptors went 9-32 after the Siakam trade and finished with their fewest wins since 2011-12. ""I don't know [whether] to call this a rebuild or a reset or however we want to put it, but a normal rebuild with other teams takes ... five, six years. Do we have the patience for that?"" Raptors president Masai Ujiri said in February. A three-to-five-year rebuild starts with a stockpile of draft picks and a group of young first-round picks on their rookie contracts. 

> The Raptors are not in that position. They are in a similar place to the Pacers retool that started in February 2022 when Domantas Sabonis was swapped for Tyrese Haliburton. 

> Instead of the All-Star Haliburton to build around, the Raptors have a franchise player in Scottie Barnes. Barnes, Quickley, Barrett, Jakob Poeltl, Gradey Dick and Kelly Olynyk give Toronto with a foundation to work from. 

>The Raptors also have $40 million in expiring contracts (Brown and Chris Boucher) to use in a trade either in the offseason or closer to the deadline. They could also enter free agency with close to $32 million if Brown's option is declined.

> **Offseason finances**: The Raptors are in position to have cap space for the first time since 2015 if they decline Brown's option and renounce all their free agents except for Quickley. They have until June 29 to pick up Brown's option. 

> If the option is declined, Toronto could create up to $26 million in room. Quickley has a $12.5 million hold, and the Raptors can use cap space before re-signing the guard, who will be a restricted free agent. Not including a new contract for Quickley, Toronto has $93 million in guaranteed salary. If the Raptors remain over the cap, they'll have the $12.9 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception and $4.7 million biannual exception. 

> The Raptors also have two trade exceptions ($10.2 and $1.6 million). They would have the $8 million room midlevel exception if they operate as a cap space team.

> **Top front office priority**: Do not expect the Raptors to lose their starting point guard in free agency again. Quickley is a restricted free agent and it is all but certain Toronto will tender him a one-year, $8.5 million qualifying offer by June 29. 

> The real negotiation starts the day after the Finals end, when Quickley and the Raptors can begin discussing a new deal. In the role as full-time starter, Quickley averaged a career-high 6.8 assists and 18.6 points. The Raptors averaged 114.1 points per 100 possessions and were a plus-2.9 with Quickley sharing the court with Barrett and Barnes. A four-year, $109 million contract with a starting salary of $24.5 million would put Quickley in the middle of the pack of starting point guard salaries. The average starting point guard salary in 2024-25 is $27.8 million. 

> The Raptors also have a decision to use Brown's $23 million salary as a trade chip or to create cap space. Brown averaged 9.6 points but shot only 31.7% on 3-pointers. Because of the minimum salary rule, the Raptors need to spend at least $126.9 million of the salary cap by the first day of the regular season.

> **Extension candidate to watch**: Expect Barnes to join Siakam, Chris Bosh and Vince Carter as the only rookie max extensions in franchise history. Barnes is eligible to sign a five-year, $225 million contract that could possibly increase to $269 million if All-NBA language is negotiated. 

> Before breaking his left hand on March 1, Barnes was averaging a career-high 19.9 points, 8.2 rebounds and 6.1 assists. His 3-point shooting improved from 28.1% to 34.1%. Barnes was one of four players this season with multiple games of 30 points, 3 blocks and 3 steals, along with Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Victor Wembanyama.

> **Team needs**: Point guard depth and bench scoring on the perimeter. The Raptors could go with a combination of Liberty-Freeman and Brown (if his option is exercised) behind Quickley. Liberty-Freeman started four games in March, averaging 12.5 points. The Raptors ranked 28th in 3-point percentage from their reserves.

> **Future draft assets**: If Toronto does send its 2024 first to San Antonio, the Raptors would then be allowed to trade their 2025 first starting on the night of the draft. If the first is retained, the next allowable year is 2027. The first owed to San Antonio is top-6 protected in 2025 and 2026. Toronto is owed a future first-round pick from Indiana (top-4 protected in 2026 and 2027). The Raptors also have four second-round picks available."

62,What's happening to Pascal Siakam's shot?,"Hi everyone, first-time poster here. I've been a fan of the Sacramento Kings for over 20 years, and in Kings fandom circles, there's a lot of talk about OG and Siakam as potential trade targets. (Though, truth be told,  I don't know if Masai Ujiri would accept any offer that the Kings FO could realistically make).

What I want to know is, what's happening with Pascal Siakam's outside shot? I know he's been a bit up-and-down for his career, with some legitimately good outside shooting years - but in the early going this year, he's at 24.5% as of this post **\[EDIT: as of 14 hours after this post, make that 23.6%\]**. Does his shot look visibly worse than before? Is there something funky going on with the Raptors offense? Something else?

The reason I ask is that in Sacramento, our two cornerstone players are DeAaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis. Early season numbers currently notwithstanding, however, neither of these guys is a consistent threat from three-point range - so it's generally been accepted that for the sake of spacing, we need to surround them with three other starters who are all consistent three-point shooters. Otherwise, opposing defenses can just pack the paint against us.

This seemed like a good place to ask about this, since I haven't seen a lot of Raptors basketball lately. And this isn't to knock Siakam's overall game - if he were on the Kings, he'd easily be one of our top two players, maybe 3rd best on a bad night. This is purely a question of fit. (If I had to choose, I'd think of OG Anunoby as a more natural fit for our team - someone who could give us much needed perimeter defense while also being a lethal outside threat, even if I think Siakam is overall more talented)."

23. Toronto Raptors

Last season: 41-41

Masai Ujiri admitted at media day that the Raptors explored trades for stars this summer, but he also said he looked at going younger. This comes as no surprise, as it’s been widely reported that Toronto hasn’t chosen a direction. Right now, the team is stuck in the middle, with Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby both one year away from free agency and a strong collection of young players—headlined by Scottie Barnes and rookie Gradey Dick—ready to lead a youth movement. The question now is whether a potential trade will emerge this season to tip the scales or whether Toronto will continue to bide its time."

Pascal Siakam is no longer a Raptor and while there will be plenty of time to reflect on his unique legacy for what he meant to Toronto for his incredible development story and his key part in the team's first championship.  For now, let's talk about the trade and what was received.

In return for the All-NBA forward, the Raptors received...

* Bruce Brown
* Jordan Nwora
* Kira Lewis Jr.
* 3 first-round picks
* A $10 million-ish trade exception

Let's go over each one, shall we?

# Bruce Brown

https://preview.redd.it/mqhtf47yacdc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bb874ce701eced9c13136fc6d34d1b38f72a11

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  12.1 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 3 APG (1.2 turnovers) on 47.5/32.7/81.7 shooting**

Bruce Brown is not going to be a Raptor for long.  Aside from an awkward ""Rasheed Wallace on the Hawks"" game or three, all points indicate he will be moved to another team and his presence in the rotation will be temporary.  As such, it feels almost pointless to talk about his solid defense, his deceptively good shooting (look up how well he hits 3s from the right corner) or his glorious facial hair.  

The way I see it, there are three routes that Toronto can take in an eventual BBB trade:

**1A is for assets**:  You've probably heard about the Knicks being interested in Bruce Brown and they're not the only team.  Brown is a playoff-caliber player with plenty of experience from his time in Denver and given his contract has a very team-friendly option in, well, his team option for the 2024/25, it makes him valuable for a contender who might be willing to give up a pick(s) or young player who they don't have time to develop.  On his own, Brown has enough interest that he can probably fetch a first-round pick on his own, a young player, a swap or potentially a combination of the three depends on how desperate certain teams may be to make a playoff push.  Most recently, the Knicks came up as a potential Brown suitor with a presumed package based around Evan Fournier's (more or less, it's a team option) expiring contract.  Whether they come with a swap, a pick or the currently being shopped guard Quentin ""You is not him"" Grimes is besides the point which is to say that Brown's value alone makes this trade somewhat incomplete.

**Press 2 for Help now**:  We'll touch on the other assets that were received in the trade and potential moves to be made but while Brown cannot be aggregated with other players, he can be included with draft capital in order to acquire a player(s) that the Raptors are interested in to get Scottie Barnes some more immediate help.  They're obviously not going to land Lauri - especially not when we dive in to the picks they got for Siakam - but 3 additional picks can allow the Raptors to make some use of their currently unused bench salary as well as Brown's own semi-expiring contract (It has a team option).

**Dial 3 for salary relief**:  Because of how much he's making over the course of this season, roughly *$22 million*, Brown offers an option to take on a larger salary in the form of a bad contract that might up the return in the short or long run; the first one that comes to mind is Ben Simmons who a) the front office has been interested in for some time and b) is on a massive deal for 2 more years and c) is on a team that can offer compensation in the form of a forward via one of their two 2023 rookies (Noah Clowney or Dariq Whitehead) or a pick in the 2025 draft.

Other ""bad contract"" names to note:

* Andrew Wiggins
* Jordan Poole
* John Collins
* De'Andre Ayton
* Evan Fournier\*
* De'Andre Hunter
* Davis Bertans\*\*

^(\*Fournier's final year is a team option with no penalty for declining)

*\*\*Davis Bertans has an early termination option for 2024's offseason of roughly $5 million*

I've also seen some suggestions that Lowry or Chris Paul are bad contracts but while they are making a lot of money, they're also an expiring contract unlike the trio of Wiggins, Poole and Ayton, to say nothing of John Collins contract.  Hunter in particular is a name to keep an eye on as there were reports of the Raptors being interested in him - though how much stock one wants to put in to this as reflective of the Raptors intentions now as opposed to one or the other team sharing this in order to to drum up interest from other teams is up for debate.

While it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Raptors keep Brown, it makes more sense to move him to a contender or pretender willing to provide something that can help the Raptors out with their ongoing retool.

*TL;DR - Bruce Brown is less worth considering for what he brings to the team and what he'll eventually be moved for.*

# Jordan Nwora

https://preview.redd.it/32kfv31nccdc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b7b8ae5627ba3d91b206fb44e691048acb121b

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  5.2 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 1 APG (0.7 turnovers) on 45.1/30.6/81.8 shooting**

Look, Jordan didn't play tonight so it was either this or a photo of him guarding a Raptor while on the Pacers/Bucks.

For those that like to complain about the length of my posts, you're in luck!  There's barely anything to say about Jordan Nwora.

Nwora is a player who should be better than he is.  A 6'8 forward with some shooting chops and a 6'11 wingspan, he showed some promise in Milwaukee on the offensive end with a then-career 3-point percentage of 40.3%.  His defense was not stellar but at the very least he gave the Bucks a mild scoring option off the bench before being traded away as part of a deal to bring in Jae Crowder.

In Indiana, his 2022/23 was more of the same; with more minutes (Going from 15 a night to 25 in the same season) and therefore opportunities, Nwora showcased his 3-ball with higher attempts and the same relative efficiency from outside the arc with

The same cannot be said for his most recent season.  Whether one wants to pin this on a reduced role in the rotation due to Rick Carlisle's firm coaching tactics/emphasis on defense or a general slump, Nwora's main selling point is at a career-low in both attempts (2 per game) and makes (30.6% for the season), and while he might find a new role in Toronto, it does not bode well for him if he isn't able to carve out a spot in the rotation for a team still in serious need of bench scoring now that Gary Trent Jr. is back to starting.

In fact, I would describe Nwora as a slightly larger Gary Trent Jr. with notably worse defense.  Say what you will about Gary gambling on steals, at least he's trying.  

Jordan, on the other hand, has the size to be a good defender but routinely fails to put in effort on that end of the floor, his shooting is streaky and while neither are willing passers, i'd say Gary has at least shown a greater desire to stop chucking up tough shots and pass his way out of them, especially as of late.  Jordan is not a terrible player by any means and at the age of 25 his trajectory is not set in stone but he's shown little improvement to his overall game and when one and a half of those seasons are in an ideal spot for him to grow i.e. a young core with a rising superstar in Tyrese Haliburton, it's hard to put much stock in to Nwora growing any further than he has with the Raptors.  He's a low-risk, low-reward player that might help space the floor but his ineptitude on the other end of the floor will almost certainly make it difficult to give him consistent minutes short of a paradigm shift on defense, especially with the far younger Gradey Dick having more upside in a similar role as a flamethrower off the bench.

*TL;DR Jordan Nwora is a flier on a low-level player who isn't likely to become more than a bench player - if he even cracks the second unit's rotation at all.*

# Kira Lewis Jr.

https://preview.redd.it/i0a9spt6gcdc1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a7a7c4dc5765ec1e73f5bd0caa065381f1ac39

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  2.9 PPG, 0.9 RPG, 1.2 APG (0.5 turnovers) on 30.8/10/90.9 shooting**

Second verse, same as the first for the picture though unlike Jordan, it would be a genuine surprise if Lewis played a second for Toronto because despite boasting the lofty drafting pedigree of being a 13th overall pick, Kira has been nothing short of a disappointment.

Part of that is due to injury; he tore his ACL after stringing together a few decent games in November 2021, tearing it early in December when facing the Nuggets which cut his time in said game - and his sophomore season - to a close.

Part of that is circumstantial; being on the Pelicans, Lewis had to play behind point forward Zion, lead Lonzo Ball and - when they acquired him - Tamper Master CJ McCollum who's been relegated to the lead point position, all of which led to a lack of opportunities for Kira in New Orleans.

Mostly...he's just not good.  He's comparable to Malachi Flynn in that he's a short PG who has shown some capability of being a rotation-caliber player though he has a more notable burst to his first step.  That said, he's not good at orchestrating the offense and it's only a slight exaggeration to say his scoring capabilities are genuinely worse on his best days than Malachi's were on his worst.  He isn't a strong defender, he struggles to finish at the rim and while he doesn't turn the ball over that much, he makes enough mistakes on both ends that it's hard to truly afford him any opportunity unless one's intention is to lose games.

Kira Lewis Jr. can only barely be called an NBA player and even then, it's a case of following the letter of the law because he very rarely shows a reason to give him time on the floor short of injuries sapping one's team of their more capable or promising players.  It may very well be unfair to fliers to to call Lewis one because of how low a chance it is he'll even be in the NBA come next season, as he's shown nothing substantive to warrant a second contract.  It would be a surprise if the Raptors put forth a qualifying offer barring a miraculous turnaround.

As an aside, it is both amusing and infuriating that Pacers somehow managed to ***get*** draft capital for the honor of rerouting Lewis to the Raptors when Toronto is the one paying the remainder of Lewis Jr.'s salary...and probably not much more than that unless Lewis manages to salvage his career and become a quality rotation player - something he was unable to do with Dyson Daniels taking his spot as the backup point in his rookie season.  At the very least, the Raptors made use of the exception from the O.G. trade so they could create a slightly larger exception that we'll touch on in a bit.

With Schroder potentially being on the move at the deadline along with Brown, Lewis Jr. might get some more opportunities to show off but he's given little reason to be hopeful that he'll make the most of it.  Put another way, it's not a great sign when the most notable contribution a player brings is an exception to potentially bring in another, better player.

*TL;DR Kira Lewis Jr. has had flashes of being a capable player but is best treated as a flier unless he can show something he failed to in New Orleans.*

# A Quick Summary on the Players

The fact that the two young guys who've been included with Brown have so little upside is what makes this trade so frustrating.  Regardless of what Bruce can bring back or the drafted players, the fact of the matter is Nwora and Lewis are low upside players who might not even manage to take a spot in a rotation that could soon become in need of a backup point guard and is currently in need of greater forward depth after trading away Siakam and O.G.  Neither of them scream future All-Star or even start-level player and one of them 

# Draft Capital

This is where the most of the contention of this trade comes from i.e. whether the Raptors got ""a haul"" for an expiring Siakam: The draft picks the Raptors got back.  To be sure, 3 first round picks is not nothing...but a closer examination of those picks should serve to illustrate that not all picks are created equal.

**Pacers own 2024 pick** (Currently tied for 19th) - Top 3 protected

**The worst of the Thunder's 2024 picks (OKC's own or the Clippers)** \- Unprotected

**Pacers own 2026 pick** \- Top 4 protected

While the season is far from over, right now those 2024 picks are looking to be at the back half of the draft, with both likely to end up in the 20s barring extended away time from Tyrese Haliburton or an injury to more core players.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the urgent push for the Siakam trade was to help keep their season afloat so they didn't need to rush Haliburton back from recovering in order to make the playoffs as the Pacers are notoriously anti-tanking/pro-competing every season.  And with how bad the worst teams in the league have been, landing in the Top 3 to keep said pick if the season goes downhill is not an option.

If the playoffs were to happen right now, this is what the Raptors would be looking at without worrying about what would happen to their own pick in the lottery:

How you feel about the draft capital coming the Raptors way depends on whether one is confident the Pacers will re-sign Siakam and how much one likes the players in this draft since the Raptors now have 3 picks in the 2024 NBA draft - four if they keep their own first which is currently 7th in lottery odds.

The Raptors certainly don't feel too strongly about it, or at least they didn't until more recently, given they traded out of this draft to acquire Jakob Poeltl.  The 2024 draft has garnered a lot of comparison to the 2000 NBA and while there were 3 All-Stars in that draft, they were all one-timers with one of them being regarded as ""the worst All-Star ever"" in Jamaal Magloire.  The 2000 draft still produced several good players but when compared to your average draft, not a single one of them stands out as  a franchise changing talent even if one were to assume Kenyon Martin or Hedo was playing in today's NBA.

While i'm very much in favor of keeping our pick, it's with the explicit acknowledgement that said pick is more valuable to help build around Scottie right now i.e. get a rotation level player either through the draft or trade it to get someone who fits that description, rather than waiting until 2025.  I haven't done a deep dive into the draft but while there are a few players i've taken a look at who have some level of intrigue to them, very few stand out as having starter level upside or higher.

Beyond the level of prospects one has to look at, drafting 3-4 rookies is a very unlikely scenario so it's very unlikely all the 2024 draft picks will stick around, which is where the one notable positive can be given to the acquired draft capital.  Bad picks or not, 3 of them is nothing to sneeze at and even a bad draft can see the team make moves leading up to it; even the 2000 draft saw teams like the Magic make use of what draft capital they had in smart trades (albeit the smartest thing the Magic did was draft the Rookie of the Year via trading down to get him plus future draft picks in a stronger class).  What player a team could be lured by either of the 2024 draft picks that would be of interest to the Raptors is not known at the moment but it is worth noting the Raptors have a slew of expiring contracts in Otto Porter Jr., Thad Young, Bruce Brown and Gary Trent Jr. that could be very easily have a  first attached to them for some help off the bench. 

In the off-chance no deal is made in the coming weeks, here are some names to note that could fall in to the range the Raptors could either draft without further moves - or by trading up/down to acquire fitting talent for their current roster's weaknesses:

* **Tyrese Proctor (G)**:  Despite this being a pretty guard-heavy draft, there aren't a lot of them in the Raptors expected range that are particularly noteworthy or at least ones that would fit what the Raptors are looking for in their guard rotation.  Tyrese Proctor is the exception, a score-first guard who can make his own shot but isn't afraid to pass the ball if a better shot can be taken.  Also he's *Australian*.  Shrimp on the BBQ.
* **Justin Edwards (F)**:  Believe it or not, Edwards was seen as a potential candidate for the 1st pick in this draft.  The fact that he's a player who could be in the 18-35 range should tell you how his college season has gone.  He's...not consistent, to put it mildly.
* **Tidjane Salaun (F)**:  Masai was recently spotted scouting in France and this was the player he was presumed to have his eye on.  A big win who's very raw as a prospect but has a ton of defensive upside and sports terrific athleticism at the wings.
* **Kel'el Ware (C)**:  A center who was originally expected to go in the 2023 draft but went back to college to improve his draft stock after a disappointing college season...which he has not.  Ware's potential is intriguing as a modern big man but the flashes he's shown lack consistency and his free throw shooting is at odds with an admittedly hot hand from 3 (on very low volume).  With Koloko being waived and his career in potential jeopardy, a backup big could be a significant need for the team; at 6'10, Jontay Porter is slightly undersized to be banging in the paint with the biggest centers in the league despite his recent success propelling him to start for the team.
* **Ryan Dunn (F)**:  One of the best defensive prospects, he mainly lacks the 3 part of ""3 and D"" wing archetype that's so widely coveted in the league.  He's an advanced stats lover's dream.
* **Zach Edey (C)**:  I'm not going to list every center in this draft because outside of Alexandre Sarr and Kel'el Ware they're not interesting as prospects but Zach is at least worthy of being mentioned.  He was expected to go undrafted in the prior 2 drafts and returned to college both times.  Now, he's a potential late first/early second and he's one of the most dominant players in college basketball...albeit he's a bit slow footed and not particularly mobile at 7'4 and nearly 300 lbs.

Beyond trading up, down or out of this draft leading up to the first or second draft night, there is one other interesting scenario to consider:  Be it Brown, Boucher or another player, the Raptors could make a subsequent move to swap the worst of the Clippers/OKC 2024 pick with another team to increase the position from where the Raptors will draft and could either let them more easily secure one of the above names or nab a player not listed that may have gone earlier and thus would not have been selected.  The Rockets did this same thing last year and moved up a whopping 10 spots(!) which let them select one of the steals of the 2023 draft in Cam Whitmore.

Some teams to keep in mind for a potential swap:

* **Rockets**:  You've likely seen the news but if you haven't, there's some speculation that the Rockets - due to Ime's relationship with Bruce - is a prime candidate to land him and they do have easy salary matching in the form of Jeff Green and Victor Oladipo.  It is unlikely they'd give up a swap for the Nets pick given it's projected to be 8th in the draft at the moment, however, unless it came with some protection and given the Rockets signed Fred away in free agency, the Raptors may be inclined to do business elsewhere.  Oh and no they probably aren't giving up Green...nor should the Raptors want him, Jalen Green is bordering on bust territory.
* **Pelicans**:  No, you aren't going to get a swap for the Lakers pick they own if it's in the lottery but you might be able to get the worse of those two picks, which is closer to the early 20s than late.
* **Suns**:  It goes without saying there's no way to match Brown's salary in Phoenix but Boucher's name was commonly thrown around in 2022 when there was apparent interest in the Raptors trading for Ayton.  Additionally, the new FO has been swap happy, to the point where they swapped the same pick twice to shore up their few assets.  That said, the salary matching becomes significantly more difficult since it would likely have to be centered around Nassir Little's $6.2 million salary and, more concerning, they are in the play-in race which may dissuade them from swapping this year's pick given one bad game could land them in the lottery via the play-in tournament
* **Knicks**:  Fournier's contract was already mentioned but apparently Quentin Grimes has been made available and, if the O.G. trade was any indication, there is little to fear about James Dolan vetoing the trade for the pettiest of reasons
* **Heat**:  Lowry's expiring contract has been the go-to trade target for a lot of big time moves involving Miami along with picks and some of their young guys but it would make for a bit of an awkward reunion were Miami to simply dump him back in Toronto with a swap after he contributed to two lengthy postseasons for the Heat.

*TL;DR - 3 picks is a lot and some of them could be used to make immediate moves but the quality isn't there between the lateness and the weakness of this draft.  The 2026 pick could be something depending on circumstances.*

# Trade Exception

I'm going to keep this to its own pseudo TL;DR because this team rarely makes use of the trade exceptions they generate.  They didn't do anything with the one created by dumping Dragic, they didn't use the one we got by trading Chris Bosh and while $10 million isn't a small amount of money, there aren't any bad contracts that come to mind for said exception to absorb and it's not like the Raptors have any free roster slots at the moment to bring one in by simply using their recently acquired draft capital.  The trade exception is interesting on its own but in practice it's unlikely to see use though at least the Raptors don't need to use it immediately i.e. they can carry it over to the offseason and part of the 2024/25 season.

# Other Considerations

* Between Bruce, Nwora and Lewis' expirings, the likes of Trent Jr., Otto Porter Jr. and Thad Young being on the final year of their deals, coupled with the various cap holds/rights that would allow the Raptors to free up cap space, Toronto could be looking at upwards of $30 million before factoring in the MLE to fill out their rotation; chasing after LeBron is unlikely to happen even if we draft his son with one of our picks but this isn't the worst free agency class to add talent for free\*
   * Names to note for the 2024 free agency class:  Nic Claxton (Nets), Buddy Hield (Pacers), Saddiq Bey (RFA for Hawks), Jalen Smith (Pacers), DeMar DeRozan (Bulls) and Jonas Valanciunas (Pelicans) for a good ol' Raptors Reunion™, Malik Monk (Kangz), Kelly Oubre Jr. (76ers), Mike Conley (Timberwolves), Patrick Williams (RFA for Bulls...but please no)
      * It would be very funny if we somehow landed O.G. or Siakam but the chances of that are so unlikely that it barely warrants mentioning
* With the Raptors pick being so lightly protected and the high difficulty of catching up to the Blazers for the 5th odds when Portland has the 2nd most difficult remaining schedule, expect to see more minutes of Gradey Dick with the team because holding 6th will be a challenge in of itself with the Grizzlies being tied in odds with us at the moment
   * Note:  This section was written before the Grizzlies recently reacquired the 6th best odds in the lottery
* Now that the trade is done and over with, there is no more uncertainty about the team's direction and, more importantly, in the locker room; last year's deadline was full of Raptors names in rumors  and the players knew that some of them may be on the bloc.  It no doubt affected their performance and while there are likely further moves to be made, it is likely a relief that they no longer have to worry about what will happen to the former #1 option on the team as the FO makes like a father in July and commits to BBQ.
* **KOLOKO WAIVED**
   * While there is a lot of speculation as to what will happen to Christian, this is a significant blow to the Raptors center rotation even in spite of Porter's making the most of his starts for the past two games.  Even if he's re-signed later on or signed to the G-League, the Raptors will probably need to grab a backup big or potentially a center who can grow in to a starting role as Jakob ages.  For now, it's a surprise to see Koloko be waived and the retaining of the older players on the roster may suggest another deal is in the works that may require the expiring salaries of Thad Young or Otto Porter Jr. (Temple is probably sticking around, it's not like he's making all that much).

# Conclusion

I wanted to give myself some time to both process the fact that Siakam is no longer a Raptor and to evaluate this trade as fairly as possible without my immediate reaction clouding my judgement because, needless to say, that reaction was not one of thrill and excitement.  For most fans, it was disappointing to see Pascal go and even moreso for the package he went for.

No Walker.  No Mathurin.  No Smith.  Not even Ben Sheppard was sent our way.  Just 3 picks of dubious quality, one good roleplayer and two players who will be lucky if they become roleplayers half as good as Bruce Brown.  The fact that O.G. Anunoby and Jrue Holiday - both technically exprings as their respective player options are expected to be declined - got their respective teams more of what could be described as a haul despite Pascal being a better player than both only makes this look all the worse at the moment.

What this trade this most reminds me of the Vince Carter trade, in that it was the culmination of an awkward affair between a player and their front office, and a disappointing return of players/picks given the talent being sent out that was the definition of trading for pennies on the dollar.  It was a move that both signaled a new era is upon us and that said era was not going to get any immediate help for then ascending superstar Chris Bosh...though thankfully Bruce Brown suited up unlike Alonzo Mourning.  

To be clear, this trade isn't anywhere near as bad as the Carter one was, if only due to this front office being a very different one than the old front office that botched the relationship with Vince in the first place and far more capable of savvy drafting as opposed to the one that passed on two future All-Stars who were selected right after their respective busts in consecutive drafts.  

That said, Bobby Webster and Masai Ujiri are the same people at the helm who are responsible for a lesser offer than what could have been worked out if they were more decisive instead of desperate at the prior year's deadline to keep together a core that clearly wasn't working. While one can certainly empathize with how difficult a decision it must have been to move on from Pascal Siakam, it is not an absolution from criticism with how they handled both the trade and the final offseason with the team's All-NBA forward - the very same one who saw the writing on the wall with ""SCOTTIE"" in big red letters and still suited up to play for the team he had already sacrificed so much for, even if it meant taking a reduced role in a contract year for a player who, although on a rapid rise, is still not quite on his level.

Even if one puts aside the hindsight goggles. Even if one acknowledges the emotional weight of this decision.  Even if one understands the sentimentality that informed this trade of Masai doing right by Pascal via sending him to a team he wanted to go to, there is not a single piece in this trade that one can feel immediately good about.  Bruce Brown is a good player but he's both not expected to be here long nor is he on the same level of player that Pascal is, and he doesn't come with Bird Right to ease the uncertainty of re-signing him in 2025.  Neither Lewis nor Nwora seem like they'll be capable of cracking an adequate team's rotation and the draft capital, while plentiful, is unlikely to yield a player as good as Pascal nor a roster as deep as the championship team he won his first ring on....not for a few seasons at least, if ever.

For the Pacers, this is an absolute swindling of a deal.  For the Raptors?  It's incomplete for now but even with a homerun trade for Brown, it's not looking too great - and with the lengthy endeavor that was the teambuilding around DeMar, it does make me wonder how long it will be before this team will be competitive once again with the rising star that is Scottie Barnes."
67,(Almost) Courtside with the Raptors vs. Knicks: Beyond the Broadcast,"Experiencing a game up close is an entirely different beast, and last night's Raptors-Knicks face-off was no exception—so much goes unseen on TV.

&#x200B;

* The NBA players' camaraderie shone bright when OG beamed after Bruce Brown’s playful trash talk following a missed three—a moment of players' just enjoying ball.  
 
* ""Box out, Josh!"" echoed from Brown to Hart during Boucher's free throw—an amusing lesson in rebounding 101 from one glue guy to the next.  This was just after RJ Barrett’s lone-wolf fast break met Darko Rajaković’s unmistakable plea for teamwork to pass to an open Brown.  
 
* Anticipation buzzed as Gradey landed consecutive threes; Gary Trent Jr.'s grin towards Darko while waiting to play said it all—the bench's excitement was palpable.  
 
* Precious Achiuwa delivered a crossover dunk on Dick that turned heads, earning mutual nods from Porter Jr. and McDaniels—an acknowledgment of sheer athleticism.  
 
* Quickley transformed halftime into showtime with ball boys running mock football plays—a creative mix-up showing the lighter side of NBA games.  
 

In between plays, there was one Knicks staffer whose energy couldn't go unnoticed—dishing out warmups, various drinks, and back wraps with such dedication. Players like Gary Trent Jr., always polite and grateful made these exchanges more than just routine—they were moments of genuine respect and gratitude.

From his vantage point in the tunnel alongside the Winklevoss twins stood Masai Ujiri deep in thought—it wasn’t just about wins but fostering community ties that resonate deeply. Siakam's recent loss brought this home even more as I reflected on how Ujiri has been not only a leader but also a mentor off-court—as seen through heartfelt Instagram tributes to support staff by players who've found family within their teams.

Last night had it all—from dynamic gameplay to poignant connections beyond basketball itself! "

104,A Speedrunner's Guide to the 2024/25 Season - And Why Tanking Won't Be on the Menu for the Toronto Raptors,"The 2024/25 Toronto Raptors season is going to be an interesting one to watch.

Between a frequently teased rebrand ahead of what will be their 30th season and the team retooling round their now uncontested face of the franchise in Scottie Barnes with both established talent (RJ Barrett, Davion Mitchell and Immanuel Quickley) and rookies looking to prove their own (Ja'Kobe Walter, Branden Carlson, Jamal Shead), the Raptors have a lot of moving parts going in to what will be a historic year for the franchise.

# To Tank, or Not to Tank:  Looking at the Rest of the League

One of the more highly debated topics of late is whether the Raptors should tank in the 2024/25 season, usually in conjunction with trading Jakob Poeltl to make the team worse.

To be sure, adding one of Cooper Flagg, Ace Bailey, Khaman Maluach or even brother of Raptors Legend Ron Harper Jr. in Dylan Harper, among whomever else ends up being a projected top pick in the 2025 draft would be a positive for the team.  Talent is talent and having a cost-controlled rookie with high upside only further raises the ceiling for a team mired in the midst of a rebuild, retool, whatever you want to call the team's current status.

Ignoring that there is no guarantee the Raptors will get a Top 4-5 pick in this draft should they somehow end up with a bottom 4-5 record come season end, that Masai Ujiri-run teams generally avoid tanking to start the season (Trading Rudy Gay and shutting things down in the Tampa Tank that landed Scottie were mid-to-late decisions informed by a bad losing streak for both - and the former ended up making a turning point for the team as the 2013/14 Raptors ended up making the playoffs), or that Masai Ujiri's own contract is coming up for renewal as it expires in 2026 will incentivize him and Bobby Webster to put forward a competitive team that makes the play-in or playoffs outright sooner than anticipated (which should serve to inform why the Raptors went with known talent in the O.G. trade over picks via Quickley and RJ)...the proposition fails to answer a simple question.

Barring another season-ending injury or some other unforeseen turmoil that changes the season early on like a tough opener that leads to an unexpectedly poor record like going 3-12 in the first 15 games, how exactly are the Raptors going to out-tank the bottom feeders in the East?  There's 15 teams in the conference and only 5 of them miss out on the postseason outright, albeit only 8 will make the playoffs outright.  In order words, of the teams who don't appear to be a lock for the playoffs, 4 of them have to make the 7/8 and 9/10 play-in tournament, regardless of their record.

In other words, of the Pistons, Wizards, Hornets, Raptors, Hawks, Bulls and Nets, two of those teams have to make the 9/10 play-in game, regardless of whether they're a 0.500 team or if there's an enormous gap between them as the 9/10 seed and whomever is the 8th seed.  So let's forget whatever Vegas says the odds are for Toronto's over/under and take a brief look at the rest of the bottom half of the Eastern Conference's landscape to see what the Raptors are going up against:

*Detroit Pistons*

* As much as one can criticize the **Detroit Pistons** for overpaying a player who went 0/2 in the 76ers elimination game, acquiring him is a talent upgrade
   * This should speak for itself as to the level of talent of Detroit so don't expect them to be in the running for a play-in spot when the 5th pick in the draft has their name written on it.  They aren't going to be very good though they should be better than the franchise-worst record they ended with
   * Additionally, it worth noting that while LaMelo Ball has been highlighted for his inability to stay on the floor, Cade Cunningham has had similar bouts with his health in trying to stay on the court, most notably with him missing the vast majority of his sophomore season following a rookie season that started slow due to him recovering from a preseason injury to his lower body
   * It is possible one of the Pistons young players like Jalen Duren have a breakout year but expecting all of them to improve is unrealistic given Detroit's recent history with struggling to develop their lottery talent

*Washington Wizards*

* The **Washington Wizards** are still going to be awful, arguably they'll be even worse than they were last year with Kyle Kuzma potentially being on the trade bloc and Tyus Jones return not being guaranteed
   * The latter is important because that means the ball will likely be in Jordan Poole's hands far more than one would like
* The addition of several new rookies like Bub Carrington and Alex Sarr - the latter of whom has been getting...a lot of criticism for his play in Summer League (because he's been really bad) - are similarly unlikely to make a positive impact though both were selected for their long-term upside and not expect to make meaningful contributions to winning basketball in their debut season

*Charlotte Hornets*

* The **Charlotte Hornets** have been good enough to make the play-in as a 9/10 seed in prior seasons when LaMelo has remained healthy...
* ...the problem is both Ball and Mark Williams have been struggling to stay on the court

*Chicago Bulls & Brooklyn Nets*

* I'm wrapping these two up together because their status is similar and straightforward:  Both the **Chicago Bulls** and **Brooklyn Nets** have gotten significantly worse after trading their best players in DeMar DeRozan and Mikal Bridges respectively, and both either barely made or missed out on the play-in's 9/10 matchup in their most recent season
* The Bulls didn't make the playoffs for those who weren't aware, though they did manage to beat the Hawks in the 9/10 matchup and the Nets straight up fell out of the race in the final stretch of the season despite trying to win due to not owning their 2024 pick at the time
   * Chicago in particular is going to be incentivized to tank so as to keep their pick as it's currently owned by the Spurs; it's Top 10 protected for the season and while the protections do get weaker in 2025/26, they're manageable for the 2024/25 season at minimum
   * Additionally, the Nets are open to trading more of their players like Cameron Johnson and thus could very easily become worse than they're already expect to be
      * An aside but I think there's a good argument that the Nets will be the absolute worst team in the league next year even if they do hold on to valuable roleplayers like Dorian Finney-Smith or the questionably available (due to injury, not in terms of if he's on the trade bloc) Cameron Johnson.  Anyone who watched the Raptors last year should be able to attest that a team where Dennis Schroder is leading your team in shot attempts is probably going to lose those games where he's the leader in attempts

*Atlanta Hawks*

* The **Atlanta Hawks** have been consistently in the running for the play-in in 3 years straight and are returning mostly the same core along with newly acquired 3 and D wing/1st overall pick in Zachary Risacher
   * While the fit was not ideal, losing Dejounte Murray for Dyson Daniels is a straight up talent downgrade; part of the reason the Hawks were in the play-in running this year was because Murray was able to keep them afloat while Trae Young was out due to injury.  It is hard to see new additions like Zachary Risacher or 3rd year Dyson Daniels making a similar impact
   * It's worth mentioning that Clint Capela has been in severe decline despite what the statline shows, and with the team's apparent apprehension to start Onyeka Okongwu as the team's starting center, it's an open question as to how their defense will hold up with Clint being the presumed starter at the 5.
   * At the same time, it is also worth noting that the Hawks are reportedly ""not done making moves"" and with the two firsts they acquired from the Murray trade and tradeable (Note:  I said tradeable, not good) contracts in De'Andre Hunter and Clint Capela, it is not out of the realm of possibility for Atlanta to put together a more well-rounded roster - and given they have no pick control barring a Nets-like trade with the Spurs to get their picks back, they have zero incentive to be bad for a top pick

This is without us even mentioning the Western Conference.  While there's likely to be a bloodbath with teams vying for a spot that, should they not make the playoffs as the 7th/8th seed, teams like the Portland Trail Blazers are likely to be near the bottom of the conference with a similar sub-30 win record to the Wizards or Pistons and while the San Antonio Spurs have a generational talent in Victor Wembanyama, that's all they really have going for them at the moment aside from an ancient Chris Paul - and it's not like they won more games with Wemby than they did the prior season.  The Utah Jazz are similarly poised to potentially post a poor record in this race to the bottom should a trade for Lauri Markkanen come to fruition or they shut him down due to an injury (It's worth noting Lauri hasn't played 70 games in a season at any point in his career and he's only played more than 60 games 3 times).

Additionally, there's always a ""lottery wildcard"", that one team that should be in the playoff picture but underperforms relative to expectations due to injuries, an impactful suspension, chemistry issues, etc.

* In 2021/22 that was the Kawhi-less Clippers going out in the play-in (That lottery pick went to the Thunder who selected Jalen Williams, for the record)
* In 2022/23 that would be the Mavericks whose midseason acquisition backfired and the team ultimately intentionally lost the last game of their season to keep their pick (albeit it lead to them getting 10th in the draft and that led to them trading down to dump Davis Bertans contract while also acquiring the impactful rookie Dereck Lively).
* In 2023/24, that was the Grizzlies losing Ja twice, once to stupid brandishing of a firearm pre-season leading to a heavy suspension and once to a season-ending injury that simultaneously finished off the team's chance at a play-in run (They did end up with the 9th pick and selected Zach Edey whose impact on the team is TBD).

Who will be that wildcard in 2024/25?  Who knows!  While it's possible it's the Raptors this year due to an untimely injury a la the 76ers in 2023/24 who wound up underperforming due to Joel Embiid being injured for a prolonged period of time, if the Raptors are healthy, it is very hard to see a world where Toronto isn't in the play-in race along with the Atlanta Hawks for the 9/10 matchup simply due to how bad the rest of the East is. While it is possible the Hornets do eke out a slightly better record if Ball manages to stay healthy alongside Mark Williams and sophomore Brandon Miller, if that is not the case, and Raptors both make the play-in but fail to make the postseason overall, then it is equally hard to not see the Raptors in a similar spot in the 2025 NBA lottery as the Hawks or Bulls were in 2024 i.e. somewhere in the latter half of the lottery from 8 onwards...

...and that's fine, I guess?  At least for where the team currently is.  Talent is important and the Raptors would obviously be better off with Cooper Flagg than without but the best-case scenario for them is a 14% chance of getting him, Bailey or whomever you pin as Scottie's co-star of the future.

Moreover, the Raptors being in a situation where they have those odds being described as ""the best-case"" belies the fact that something has to have gone horribly wrong for them to have those odds in the first place i.e. Scottie having two seasons with injuries bad enough to take him out for a lengthy period of time or several players having a career year in the worst way possible.

That's not to say the Raptors are set up for some future dynasty with a young core at nearly every position a la the OKC Thunder.  This team's roster does still have some major holes.  It's lacking in wing depth, the center rotation is up in the air as the presumed backups are both on two-way contracts (assuming Christian Koloko isn't cleared or doesn't sign with the Raptors, both of which are not out of the realm of possibility) and the number of rookies on the team does make it likely the bench is unlikely to see some serious contributions for the NBA debut of many of Toronto's youngest players - Ja'Kobe Walter is 19 and will be 19 until September, Ulrich Chomche is one of, if not, the youngest player in the NBA, etc. - but that's part of how rebuilding/retooling a team works.

It takes time, talent and some luck in either hitting on a trade or two, not to mention on one's prospects developing, and making the play-in should be seen as part of that all-important development factor.  Sure, it's not the same as playoff experience but it is a similar environment and it shouldn't be seen as negatively when there isn't much of an alternative.  Just look at the timeline of the Raptors from the first season without Chris Bosh until 2018 where they were seen as contenders:

|Season|Major Moves & Notable Accomplishments|Record & Results in the Postseason|Draft Results/Selections|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2010/11|Sign and traded Chris Bosh in the offseason and got their pick back, a Miami first they traded for James Johnson and a giant expectation that Brian Colangelo wasted|22/60 (3rd worst in the NBA)|Dropped from 3rd to 5th, drafted Jonas Valančiūnas|
|2011/12|Lockout season; signed Dwane Casey to be their head coach; the team was mostly the same as last year and they made very few moves after the draft aside from adding former All-Star Jamaal Magloire|23/43 (Tied for 7th worst record in the NBA)|8th pick (^(Lost a coin flip with the Warriors who got 7th)) and drafted Terence Ross|
|2012/13|Traded for Kyle Lowry in the 2012 offseason, Rudy Gay midway thru the season|34-48 (12th worst record in the NBA)|Tried to trade for Giannis but failed to after trading this year's pick to acquire Lowry; they did not own a 1st in this year's draft|
|2013/14|Signed Masai Ujiri to become the general manager for the Toronto Raptors in the 2013 offseason; offseason also involved the infamous Bargnani Knicks pick; traded Rudy Gay midseason for, among other players, Greivis Vásquez who would become the start of a currently ongoing trade tree; Gay's trade would mark a turnaround for the team as they would end up finishing the season strong|48-34 (3rd in the East); lost in 7 to the Nets|Ended up 20th where they infamously selected Bruno Caboclo|
|2014/15|For the team's 20th anniversary, the team overall didn't make many moves during the season but they did give Vince Carter a tribute in honor of the occasion; after a first-round exit they made the aforementioned Vásquez trade that eventually became RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and, most recently, Johnathan Mogbo after several future trades|49-33 (4th in the East); lost in 4 games to the Wizards|Once again ended up at 20 where they selected Delon Wright; traded Greivis Vásquez for the 2nd rounder that was Norman Powell in this draft and a future Clippers first in 2017|
|2015/16|First time the Raptors had 2 All-Stars in a single season since Antonio Davis and Vince Carter back in 2001, a streak that would continue until 2020/21 where no player was selected for the All-Star Game; this was the year they infamously signed DeMarre Carroll who they would end up dumping him with their 2018 1st and several seconds|56-26 (2nd in the East); won in 7 against the Pacers in the 1st round, won in 7 against the Heat in the 2nd round, lost in 6 during their first ever Conference Finals to LeBron James|The pick from the Bargnani trade conveyed at 9; the Raptors made 2 first round selections with Jakob Poeltl at 9 and Pascal Siakam at 27, with Fred VanVleet signing in free agency as an undrafted free agent|
|2016/17|Midway through the season after a lengthy losing streak, the Toronto Raptors would make a trade to acquire Serge Ibaka from the Magic for Terence Ross & a future first; their G League affiliate won the G-League championship & Siakam was named Finals MVP|51-31 (3rd in the East though their record was tied with the Cavs); won in 6 against the Bucks in the 1st round, swept by the Cavaliers|The 1st from the Vásquez trade conveyed at 23rd; the Raptors didn't own their pick due to the Ibaka trade but they used this pick to select O.G. Anunoby|
|2017/18|Franchise-high win record with 59 wins; the Raptors were seen as true contenders due to LeBron James having the worst constructed Cavaliers team during his second tenure|59-33 (1st in the East)|The pick from the Carroll salary dump conveyed and no 1st round selection was made; we all know what happened next|

This is far from a definitive summation that ignores the nuance and general improvements from both the starters and bench over this time period - and it does overlook some of the other, less notable mistakes made along the way - but it should serve to illustrate that whatever you want to call what the Raptors are doing now, becoming a regular playoff team, let alone a contender, takes a long time.

# What about Jakob Poeltl?

Like I said earlier, part of the ""tank/no tank"" discussion has been centered around Jakob Poeltl and whether the Raptors should trade him.  The Raptors themselves have, per Lewenberg, [explored trading him but haven't progressed far](https://www.tsn.ca/nba/video/~2952391) on any talks about him, and it's up in the air if Poeltl is particularly happy being on a team that is probably not going to make the playoffs outright as a Top 6 team.

This really should be given its own deeper dive but to keep the focus on expectations for the 2023/24 season and the Raptors in particular, i'll say this:  While Poeltl absolutely shouldn't be treated as untouchable and while his long-term fit with Scottie is questionable due to his lack of range, his absence is not going to be the difference maker in getting into getting some of the best odds of a Top 4 pick in what may be a historic draft on a team that's likely to be sub-0.500 with or without him.

The Raptors were bad without Poeltl last season but the constant regurgitation of the with/out record ignores that they were also without Scottie Barnes during that same stretch, not to mention both RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley were out due to their own respective family tragedies, not to mention RJ was dealing with an knee issue and playing through it at one point.  Poeltl certainly makes the Raptors better, he's a good player and that's what they do, but by how much is not as clear cut as looking at their win/loss record with/out him.

If you're trading Jakob Poeltl, it should be because you got a stupid good offer from a desperate team rather than hoping for slightly improved lottery odds.  Anyone who's seen the Pistons drop down in back-to-back-to-back drafts to 5th can tell you that that the NBA lottery is aptly named:  Sometimes you win it big (Getting number 1 in 2021's lottery and drafting Cade) and sometimes you drop from where you were expected to go in 3 consecutive drafts.

There are no guarantees in the lottery, something the Raptors should be keenly familiar with given they lost out on their own pick in this year's draft due to bad lottery luck while simultaneously jumping up from 7th to 4th in 2021 to draft Scottie Barnes.  Just as the draft itself is a crapshoot, so too is the lottery that determines who gets to draft where.

Hell, if we want to extend this out to look at the Raptors general history with the lottery, they've dropped down far more than they've jumped up.  In terms of major leaps i.e. jumping up more than 1 spot, getting 1st overall in 2006 while having the 5th best odds and 4th overall in 2021 with the 7th represent the exception rather than the rule.

[They stayed put in 2012 and 2013, for those wondering; from 2014-2021 they weren't in the lottery aside from the pick that became Jakob Poeltl; that pick stayed put at 9.  Also worth mentioning their first draft pick was the result of a coin flip for 6th that they lost to the Vancouver Grizzlies.  Also also this graphic messed up the pre-lotto\/results for 2006; they had the 5th best odds and jumped up to 1st from 5th to take Andrea Bargnani.](https://preview.redd.it/ljy9nrh59led1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=99230ab0f13d52d2ea7cc1597d14d71e38b01e3e)

There's also the fact that getting a good pick in the lottery is not a guarantee that the player selected will develop into an impactful player, let alone an All-Star/All-NBA caliber franchise piece.  To be clear, Jakob is not the latter but for all his faults, Jakob Poeltl is a known talent and while his status a ""Top 10 center"" in the league like Masai claimed when making that foolish trade for him instead of blowing up the team at 2023's deadline is debatable, he's valuable for what he brings as a defender, interior presence, screener, pick and roll recipient and an underrated passing big man who's on a perfectly reasonable contract.

He's far from untouchable - if the Knicks offer, like, Mitchell Robinson, 2 firsts and a swap then you take that deal because it's a ""too stupid to not take that deal"" offer (For the record, I don't think this offer would be on the table if we're being realistic) - but he's also not someone you just trade for the sake of making your team worse in his absence for the sake of what can be best described as minimal gain in this year's lottery.

# On Expansion

I feel like it's oft unmentioned that expansion is on the horizon, mostly due to the ongoing media rights negotiation and the recent drama regarding said rights and the opportunity to match any current deals (TL;DR the new TV deal is a mess)...but it's coming and expansion will impact *every* team.  Some of them will be affected more than others - the Timberwolves will likely be moving into the Eastern Conference due to how far they have to travel right now to face off against Western Conference teams - but every team is going to be affected by this.

How will this affect the Raptors?  Well, we're not sure yet beyond the usual ""protect 8, everyone else is up for grabs"" that comes with NBA expansion i.e. one of the Raptors current players could be taken in an expansion draft (One would assume the Raptors would protect their 4 starters from the last season, Ja'Kobe, Dick and Shead; the 8th player is up in the air and i'm not clear on whether Davion could be protected if he's not extended as he'd be a restricted free agent).

What can be said is that, once the dust settles on the media rights, the NBA is rumored to shift its focus on adding two new teams, and beyond the expansion draft, there's the inaugural draft which said teams will be a part of.  Whether or not this will be in 2025 or 2026, consider this a sort of refresher on how these new teams could affect the Raptors standing in the draft should these new teams (or if the Seattle Supersonics return, the old and new) wind up.

The NBA has a pretty lengthy history of expansion, be it brand new teams like the Bulls being introduced in 1966 or through existing teams via the merger of the ABA back in the 70s, with the league most recently adding the Charlotte Bobcats in 2004 to bring the number of teams in both conferences to an even 15 for each.

As far as it relates to the draft, the Top 3 (now Top 4) have not been affected in previous expansions of the league but the teams below that threshold are...a different story.  To keep this simple, let's quickly look at the two most recent times the NBA expanded:  The aforementioned Bobcats in 2004, and the Canadian expansion draft that saw the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies introduced to the NBA.

2004 - NBA adds the Charlotte Bobcats Bobcats are given the 4th pick in the NBA Draft

* The team(s) that would have drafted 4th-15th dropped one slot from their post-lottery position
* The Bobcats traded up to draft the 2004/05 Rookie of the Year Emeka Okafor 2nd overall

1995 - NBA adds the Toronto Raptors & Vancouver Grizzlies; the two teams flip a coin for the 6th pick & the Grizzlies won 6th

* The Grizzlies drafted All-Rookie 2nd Team Bryant Reeves 6th overall
* The Raptors drafted 1995/96 Rookie of the Year and ""man who led an expansion team to delivering the 96 Bulls one of their 10 losses"" Damon ""Mighty Mouse"" Stoudamire 7th overall
* The team that would have drafted 6th pre-expansion wound up 8th as a result of these two new teams

This is a vast oversimplification of the expansion process since those Canadian teams had a number of franchise-altering stipulations related to the draft such as not being able to win the 1st overall pick (^(For reference:  The Raptors) *^(technically)* ^(won the 1996 lottery.  This would have let them draft Allen Iverson but due to those agreements, they were not able to retain said pick; they ended up with the 2nd overall pick and the Philadelphia 76ers were given the 1st overall pick)) but to keep this as simple as possible:  **If the league does expand next year and those expansion teams are in the 2025 draft, the Raptors could drop down 2 spots from where they'll end up pre/post lottery draws - and this is before one factors in a team below them jumping up in the standings**.

Obviously, if the Raptors end up in the Top 4 or if the new teams are placed after the Raptors and Toronto doesn't end up moving down/if the Raptors move down but not lower than where the expansion teams end up (It's complicated) then none of this matters but the addition of expansion teams can lead to some very wonky results in the lottery depending on ""where"" those expansion teams are assigned their pick in the NBA Draft - and if the league decides that the heavily speculated Supersonics and Las Vegas teams or whichever curveball city gets a team are eligible for a chance at drafting Cooper Flagg/Ace Bailey than this gets even more complicated but that scenario is largely unprecedented as far as expansion teams in the draft are concerned.

Since the league is adding 2 teams, we'll look at the Canada expansion in 1995 for a bit of precedent, along with the 2004 draft with the Bobcats due to more significant movement in the lottery results vs. the records of the teams in said lottery.

In the 1995 NBA lottery, the teams selecting from 8-13 had their picks announced without any movement from their pre-draft position.  During the lottery, then-commissioner of the NBA David Stern announced that the Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies would be selecting 6th and 7th, however the order would be determined at a later time.

https://preview.redd.it/tv1zvo1e9led1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=68325be9f42262ad9282baaaaf76d0911b99dfb5

The rest of the lottery draw proceeded, with the Golden State Warriors jumping from 5th to 1st, the Philadelphia 76ers jumping up to 3rd from 4th and the Clippers, Bullets (Later renamed the Wizards) and Timberwolves dropping to 2nd, 4th and 5th respectively.

It is worth noting that there a couple of differences between the lottery then and now.  In addition to flattened odds, the NBA now selects the Top 4 picks in the NBA lottery via lottery balls as opposed to just 3 like they did in 1995.  However, there are some observations that we can make from all of this.  While none of the teams below the Raptors/Grizzlies moved up, if one of them did so then whichever team below them would have dropped would be bumped down to 8th.

This actually happened in 2004 where the teams with the worst 4 records in the NBA that season were the Magic, the Bulls, the Wizards and the Clippers.  The expansion Charlotte Bobcats were given the 4th overall pick.  The Wizards and Bulls dropped from their pre-lottery positions; the Bulls went down from 2nd to 3rd and the Wizards dropped to 5th, below the Bobcats despite having the 3rd worst overall record.

With the flattened lottery odds, a scenario this is more likely to happen than ever before; we saw similarly unlikely outcomes in this year's draft where the Atlanta Hawks and Brooklyn Nets (whose pick ended up going to the Rockets as a result of the James Harden trade) jumped up to 1st and 3rd respectively despite having the 9th and 10th best odds of a Top 4 pick in the lottery.  Even the Spurs saw a slight jump up to 4th from 5th overall.

All of this is to say that the 2025 NBA lottery could make for a very wacky outcome if the Raptors do wind up in the lottery once more, depending on where the NBA decides to place these new teams' picks.

Let's use the below scenario to illustrate this, assuming that the new expansion teams will be given the 5th and 6th pick:

* August 2024:  The NBA announces two new expansion teams:  The Seattle Supersonic and the Montreal Muskox
* April 2025:  The Raptors have another poor season and end up with the 6th worst record in the league once more
* As a result of this, the Raptors have the 6th best overall odds in the lottery
* Lottery Day:  The NBA lottery results are in and **3 teams below the Toronto Raptors** jump in to the Top 4
   * As a result of this, the Raptors should drop to 9th overall in a normal draft, however...
   * The league also announces in the middle of the draft that the Supersonics/Muskox will be assigned the 5th/6th pick in the 2025 NBA Draft; the two teams will partake in a coinflip for the 5th pick at a later date
   * As a result, all the teams that did not jump in to the Top 4 will be arranged from worst to best W/L record starting with the 7th overall pick
      * This means that the Raptors will have the 11th pick out of the 16 lottery picks in the 2025 NBA Draft despite having the 6th worst record

If we want to get technical, we would find out that the Raptors dropped to 11th/three teams jumped up in real-time on the day of the lottery i.e. before we find out where the two expansion teams end up, and there would be 16 teams in the lottery as opposed to 14.  Still, the end result is the same:  The Raptors would end up with a lower pick overall as a result of bad lottery luck and the slotting of two new NBA teams.

Now the above is a very unlikely scenario but stranger things have happened in the NBA.  Besides the risk of expanding into the Canadian economy, part of the reason the Raptors and Grizzlies faced several lottery-related restrictions were due to the Orlando Magic, then a new franchise, winning back-to-back #1 overall picks in consecutive drafts, with the 2nd year being one of the lowest overall chances for a team to win the 1st overall pick being amongst the lowest percentages a team has ever won the top pick in NBA history.  This made them a far better team more quickly than anticipated, and it wasn't long before the Magic made their way to their first ever Finals in 1995 against the Houston Rockets.

All of this is to say that this year's draft could have more reason for excitement - and dread - depending on where the lottery balls end up should the Raptors wind up in it once more."
105,A Missed Trade and the 2024 Playoff Butterfly Effect,"Remember back in the summer all the Dame hype. The surprising best offer was Toronto's bunch of picks and filler. It was looking closer and closer to a Kawhi style heist if Miami was the only other competing offer. You could see Dame's representation get desperate the way they kept name dropping Toronto as a bad destination for him. You could tell it was close. Bobby Webster even said it was the biggest trade offer they've ever made for a player. 

Then Dame finally got Milwaukee to bite on a trade. But what if they didn't?

What if Toronto sent 3 firsts plus swaps, Dick, Precious, Trent out for Dame?

I'm really glad they didn't, but you can see the butterfly effects.

- Siakam, OG, Jrue, Smart, and Brogdon wouldn't have been traded.

- Boston would run it back with the addition of Porzingis. Probably still top seed.

- Milwaukee keeps their roster. They would've been better off.

- Indiana doesn't get Siakam. They're worse off.

- Knicks don't get OG. They're worse off.

- Toronto probably at least gets into the playoff/ins. They would probably bump out Indiana if Hali is still injured and they don't get Siakam.

- Who knows, the way these playoffs shaped up, the Raps could've been out in the Playin or be playing in the conference finals.

But the problem is that Dame is starting to look past the stage of being THAT guy. He's good but not great. The Raps would need to double down on this roster without a lot of ways to improve it. OG and Siakam would get signed, and it would be rolled back for the next 3 or 4 years.

I gotta admit, I much happier with the direction that was chosen, even if the team will be worse for the next few years."
106,I would give back all the picks from the pacers,"If they included Nembhard instead. This kid is an absolute two way stud, and a perfect fit with our roster. I can’t believe we didn’t push for him 

Edit: I don’t understand the comments. I am absolutely aware that the Pacers didn’t want to give us Nembhard, otherwise he’d be on our team.

But a player of Siakam’s caliber should have gotten  us Nembhard. How we handled Siakam’s situation put us in the spot where we ended up with the weak package we got.

We can criticize the FO without being in the meetings with them. You don’t have to Bobby Webster to understand that the Poeltl trade was a bad idea."

Kyle Lowey on the Heat, NBA champ, point general, lay it all on the line. DeRozan on the Bulls, a hell of a player, hard work ethic, tough and gritty player. I could go on about FVV and OG.

112,A Speedrunner's Guide to the 2023/24 Toronto Raptors Trade Deadline: Trade Targets,"No introduction since we're character limited, let's get started.

**Pick N' Swaps**

Right, let's get the boring one out of the way.  Part of the ongoing lawsuit between the Knicks & Raptors is over a series of ""stolen documents"" & if there's anything that the Raptors resemble the Knicks - besides their players - it's in the accumulation of draft assets.  The Raptors aren't as pick heavy as one might think, notably due to lacking any second round picks - that 2019 championship team's bill is almost fully paid but the 2023 2nd traded to the Grizzlies (now owned by the Mavericks if i'm recalling where it's ended up) is still owed for Marc Gasol - &  they lack pick control of their own.  So it makes sense that they are seemingly in the midst of collecting young players on rookie deals & the next best thing via draft picks.  Notably, they managed to nab 3 first rounders for Siakam & are seeking a 4th for Bruce Brown.  Additionally, they grabbed a Detroit second that is likely to end up as the best pick on the second night of the draft.

In terms of quantity that's not nothing but as far as the quality of the picks the Raptors are likely to own - barring a combination of a monumental collapse by the Pacers & the lottery balls launching their pick to 4th - the acquired ones aren't highly valuable.  That OKC/Clippers pick in particular...it isn't going to be great.  Salary-wise it might be decent since a late first is a low cap hit & thus can allow but strictly in terms of where it falls in this draft, it doesn't give you a high level of choice for the player(s) one can select & this draft is notably weak; it's frequently compared to the 2000 NBA Draft which is in the running for worst NBA draft of all time.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkmyucpjagc1.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1dc9414c89c313974c958cc1322c7f9ead888f

This isn't the worst thing in the world given the Raptors have 2 - possibly 3 if they keep their own  that's currently owed to the Spurs - firsts to use in this draft in addition to that aforementioned highly valuable second rounder from Detroit.  However, the least valuable of OKC's multitude of firsts isn't going to be all that good of a pick on its own, hence looking for a right to swap picks.

Why a pick over a swap? Well, there's a couple of reasons.  For one, the 2024 draft in particular is highly concentrated amongst a few teams, namely the Spurs/OKC/Rockets/Knicks so that limits the number of trade partners one has for, say, a Bruce Brown or Dennis Schroder trade, irrespective of whether one of them or another player would be considered worth swapping picks.  For another, a lot of those teams who do own their pick in 2024 - or in the Lakers case, might own their pick once they know whether the Pelicans will exercise their right to their 2024 1st or defer the obligated first to 2025 - can't directly trade it due to prior commitments i.e. the Suns can't trade their 2024 1st due to the Kevin Durant trade, the Mavericks can't trade their 2025 1st due to Tingus Pingus' trade from years ago, etc.

A lot of these teams can, however, offer to swap picks, & while that is significantly less valuable than directly acquiring their draft capital, it can allow a crafty GM to move up in the draft to acquire a player.A recent example of this would be the Rockets, who traded Eric Gordon for a pick swap (fore reference, the asking price originally was a first for Eric Gordon) that allowed Houston to exchange their Bucks 2023 1st for the Clippers own first which in turn let them move up a whopping 10 spots (!) in the draft.  Granted, the 2023 NBA draft looks to be an historic one while 2024's is up in the air if there's any player, let alone players, who will become a franchise-altering star of any sort.

Of course, the Raptors don't need to get another pick or swap in this draft & there is always the possibility of stocking up on 2025 or 2026 capital to either let Toronto draft a young player in a draft they feel much stronger about or defer their draft capital usage until they can package them together to acquire a star player that pushes them closer to contention.

That brings up the the more tangible portion of this discussion.  While the current asking price of Bruce Brown is ""1 first and a 'good player'"", there isn't any reason to suggest that Toronto can't nor won't accumulate more picks/swap through trading any of their other, non-core pieces...and they have a pretty obvious means of doing so too.

**Bad (to the bone) Contracts**

The types of trades Toronto can make are easy to break down in to two categories:

* Trading their expiring for bad contracts + good players/picks
* Trading their expiring or bench players who have value on their own (Trent Jr., Schroder, etc.) & potentially include draft capital to acquire decent players/potential expiring contracts that come with draft capital.  We'll be focusing on the former while saving the latter for a different post.

Between Young, Trent Jr. & Porter's combined $32.8 million expirings before including Boucher or Schroder's own addable salary & Bruce Brown being a $22 million expiring that can't be combined with the latter players, there's an opportunity for the Raptors to take on a bad contract or three that comes with a good player(s) and/or draft capital.  It's not a likely strategy - the Raptors in recent years have prioritized financial flexibility & given Scottie's extension is coming soon they may continue to prioritize that - but given the weakness of the 2024 free agency class - a class where two former Raptors are perhaps the most enticing free agents on the market and both are equally unlikely to return - it may be preferable to take on long-term money to bolster their assets and take a stab at free agency in a stronger class such as 2025 or 2026.  It's not like the Raptors have, historically, been a major player in free agency even when it comes to courting roleplayers, to say nothing of how what few notable players like Hedo or Carroll panned out, but I digress.

There is one hitch in the ""bad contacts"" plan; there aren't a ton of overtly atrocious contracts on the books right now.  To be sure, they do exist but the ones that do should not be expected to be on the move i.e. the Wizards are probably not moving Jordan Poole who holds arguably the worst contract in the league right now & the Blazers aren't likely to give up so soon on Deandre Ayton despite a disappointing debut in Portland.

Likewise, Gobert or Dame's respective contracts might age poorly but it doesn't matter when their teams are in contention or hold the 1st seed in their respective contracts.

That said, there are a few names to note & the teams that boast them could make for mutual trade partners given where they are & what they need.  Some of them have circumstantial factors that make them less likely but none of them should be outright discounted.

Let's get started.

**Ben Simmons**

Yes he had a good game recently - good by current Ben's standards anyway - but let's not forget how long Ben Simmons has been out.

Or the player he's been ever since the infamous Game 7 against the Hawks.

Or how much he's being paid.

Besides Jordan Poole, Simmons is arguably the worst contract when one considers his production vs. how much he's being paid.  Ben might be a more productive player than Poole but between that production coming with a salary that's going to demand a whopping $40 million in 2024/25 and the astounding amount of games Ben has missed due to back injuries, among other injuries since becoming a Net (i.e. not even accounting for injuries he suffered as a 76er or even in college), not to mention Ben's well-known issues on offense and regression on his defense, it's no surprise teams aren't lining up to acquire the former All-NBA, All-Star, All-Defense 6'10 PG.  The chances he even comes close to those heights are microscopic and the contract he's coming with makes that a thoroughly unappealing risk when there's so little chance of a reward.

The one benefit Ben does has compared to Poole, beyond being a better player when he does play (which isn't saying much, Jordan Poole is a contender for worst player in the league right now if one delves in to the advanced stats), his contract is only on the books for another season after this one.  It's a lot of money to take on for said season since $40 million equates to roughly 28% of the cap for that year and said salary is going towards a player who's suited up less than 50 games over the last 3 seasons, but between the aforementioned weakness of the 2024 free agency class, a much stronger free agency class in 2025 and the players/picks Brooklyn could attach to dump Ben's contract, it's easy to talk one's self in to renting out said cap space for the young socialite to spend sometime in the 6ix if they're not confident they can sign...Jalen Smith or Nic Claxton?

As for who could be included, the aforementioned *Nic Claxton* has popped up in trade rumors & with him being a flight risk due to him being an expiring, it's not impossible to see him on the move.  Claxton is a good center.  Switchable on defense & a superb shot blocker, he might not fit the role of a stretch 5 given how few 3 points he takes but his defensive impact is worth a potential flight risk...albeit said risk does come with caveat.

Besides his free throw shooting percentages resembling Jakob's, Claxton is a difficult fit next to Poeltl & thus necessitates moving on from him, be it at the deadline or on draft night if the plan is for Claxton to be the team's center of the future and all the potential problems with fitting next to Scottie due to Nic's lack of a bag.  He's also a significantly worse passer so one shouldn't expect to operate with Claxton at the top of the key like Poeltl can.

Having said all of that, Claxton's availability may be overstated & the risk of him walking is very real given the aforementioned menial free agency class.  Arguably, he's the best available roleplayer that one could see moving teams given O.G.'s expected commitment to the Knicks that led to him being traded.  It's certainly not unfair to say he is the best center on the market; he's likely to command a heftier contract than what Jakob Poeltl earned.

This isn't to say Nic is even the most likely player to pair with Ben as the Nets have two lengthy wings that haven't see much playtime despite the odd spot that Brooklyn finds themselves in.  Both 2023 rookies, both relatively unproven 19 year-old wings, each drafted as polar opposites in terms of strengths.  Noah Clowney was notable for his offensive upside as a 6'10 forward who showed a ton of promise on defense while Dariq Whitehead's defensive potential is just that; his scoring is far more developed. Between the two, Whitehead is a lot less appealing, having suffered from injuries in college & already requiring a surgery that is expected to end his rookie season with a mere 2 games to his name.  Not to say that Clowney has played that much more - he's only hit the hardwood 3 games despite being available for more games than Dariq - but the Raptors are far more in need of size and defense than they are lacking in scoring threats.

As far as draft picks go, Brooklyn has several firsts from the Suns - all of which are protected - and there is a 2029 Dallas 1st which could be valuable depending on what happens with Luka in this postseason, assuming the Mavericks even make it that far as they're stuck in the play-in.  They also have access to some very distant firsts of their own but given their current predicament, it's unlikely they'd be willing to go for much longer without control of their own picks after the Harden trade backfired in spectacular fashion, not to mention the infamous trade made with the Celtics back in 2013.

It's hard to say what the Nets in general will do at this year's deadline.  They are in a weird spot where they can't tank due to lacking control over their own picks but have a slew of draft capital they could move either for a star or to retool their roster and keep them afloat so as to not give the Rockets a series of valuable lottery draft picks as Houston moves towards being a playoff team due to their own pick situation.  If they are planning to make a move, Ben's contract can be used to fill out the roster with roleplayers who can keep them from being in the NBA's basement.

*TL;DR - The young socialite's contract is bad but only goes on for 2 seasons.  Money is money though, and Ben is making a lot. The Nets can make renting out cap space for Ben's contract sting a lot less with the package they can create while the Raptors await to retool their bench in the 2025 offseason.*

**Andrew Wiggins**

Something something Canadian.  Now that we've gotten out of the way, let's talk about All-NBA Bad Contract 1st Team Andy.

Wiggins is notorious for his chronic underachieving in Minnesota, notably being one of the reasons Jimmy Butler forced his way off of the Timberwolves in 2018.  It's part of how Andrew wound up in Golden State, being moved in a salary dump for D-Lo and the pick that became the Kum Bucket (Yes that's Johnathan's real nickname).

In Dub territory, Wiggins managed to turn his career around and while he may not have played well enough to be an All-Star starter, he was certainly playing like an All-Star.  He was a key contributor to the Warriors 2022 title run and was indisputably the second-best player on the team that beat the Celtics in 6 games...

...and then the 2022/23 season happened.  While Draymond Green's infamous assault on Jordan Poole is pointed to as the turning point for the Warriors season - and it was - the prolonged absence of Wiggins hurt a Warriors team that lost a significant amount of depth in the offseason and while they did end up making the playoffs, it was in spite of Wiggins only playing 37 games who did not look particularly good at that...

...and then the most recent season happened.  It's a bit hyperbolic to say this is Wiggins worst season overall as i've heard many say but relative to expectations i.e. him being in his 9th year and making an All-Star appearance (regardless of whether it was due to K-pop stans) it is his most disappointing.  His shooting has regressed, his defense has regressed and in general he doesn't look like the same player he was 2-3 seasons ago.  There's been a lot of speculation as to why but the fact of the matter is that, after getting a notable extension that is easily the longest of any on this list at $109 million over 4 years - 3 not counting this current season - Wiggins has been an enormous disappointment for one and a half seasons with a notable chunk of change to his name for three more seasons - two if he turns things around since the third year is a player option but if he doesn't then one is looking at a trio of woeful Wiggins seasons.

All of this is to say, Andrew Wiggins is a frustrating player.  He always been gifted as a two-way wing but questions about his motor/general effort dated back to his college days. The fact he's regressing this much despite being only 28 years old is only further evidence of that.

As far as any sort of salary dump goes, Golden State isn't exactly heavy on the draft capital - they can only move one pick way down the line in 2028 due to a previously traded pick to the Grizzlies (now owned by the Blazers) that they're definitely not removing the protections on, light as they may be; it's Top 4 and with the Warriors being in the play-in race, it would be a baffling decision to pull off such a move barring a homerun trade or two that puts them back in to the playoff race in a bloodbath of a Western Conference.  They could swap a pick or two any years between 2027 and 2029 instead but the aging core of the Warriors makes moving any sort of draft capital a highly risky endeavor.  Thus, said swap(s) are likely to be heavy on the protections, as is likely the case with the Warriors were they to move their 2028 pick.

To be blunt, a single first or a swap or two with heavy protections seems inadequate given just how long Wiggins contract will go on for.  If Andrew can bounce back (more on that later) then it's a terrific buy-low opportunity but as far as the value he currently brings, the answer is none.

That brings us to the young players.  Or rather the one young player they might be amiable to moving.

While Kuminga is unlikely to be moved and Podziemski is equally likely to be left untouched given he's the only young Warrior who's been given some leeway with Kerr's questionable coaching decisions, the Warriors have been seemingly less attached to *Moses Moody*; referring back to Steve Kerr, he bench the third year Warrior in a game where he went 4/4 from the field in the 4th quarter's opening minutes and was rewarded by being benched and watching Golden State blow the lead he helped to create in a loss against the Kings.

Moody was the Warriors selection with their own pick in the 2021 draft and while he's no Sengun, who was available with the 14th pick, Moses has become a quality roleplayer of a shooting guard despite the lack of opportunity afforded to him.  He's shown flashes of his defensive potential and while his shooting percentage does come with the asterisk of playing next to the greatest shooter of all time in Steph Curry, there's nothing about his form to suggest he's incapable of continuing to shoot a respectable 36% from 3, especially with some of the good looks that, in theory, Scottie could be able to get Moody as well as his teammates under the similarly pass-happy 0.5 offense system Darko has been successfully employing despite the recent assist streak being broken.

Lastly, it should be acknowledged that while I don't have much faith in Wiggins rebounding from his last two mediocre seasons, he has the highest possibility of salvaging his value and, if nothing else he does fit a positional need on this team.  Given how long Andrew is under contract for, it's not as though one will be free of him if he doesn't turn his career around in a season or two so there is a lot of risk that this move will backfire.

His age makes him far from ideal for a fit next to Scottie and being a career 35.5% 3-point shooter isn't altogether impressive - especially when his few notably decent seasons have been in Golden State where one has to worry about Steph Curry more than Wiggins - but he can function as a placeholder as the Raptors restore their forward rotation after trading away O.G. and Siakam, not to mention how depleted it will be if Boucher is gone by the deadline.

*TL;DR - Wiggins is a positional fit but his long contract and current play makes him a hard sell with the Warriors lacking assets to dump his contract.*

**John Collins**

For the other ""buy low"" wing option, we have John Collins, a player that Danny Ainge bought low on in the hopes of flipping him at the deadline that has backfired to the extent that John might be one of the few trades Danny has lost on given the former Hawks forward has not rebounded to his 2020/21 form.

Like Simmons, John is not a bad player but while he would fill in the wide gap that is the team's forward rotation, he is overpaid for what he brings to the table and unlike Ben who is only on the books for this and the next season, John's final year on the books (2025/26) includes a player option he is almost certain to pick up and thus his $25.3 AAV contract is essentially there to stay for 3 years, counting the remaining season for one of those three years.  There is a possibility his value could rebound but as of right now, he's a negative asset making a not insignificant amount of money; he's the Jazz's highest paid player right now and he's arguably their 6th best player, depending on how one feels about Kelly Olynyk.  He's undersized to guard opposing centers but his skillset best suits him at the 5 instead of the 4.  He's improved defensively in the past two seasons but his offense remains limited.

As far as compensation for Collins' contract, the Jazz have a significant stash of draft picks they can part with, namely unprotected firsts from Cleveland or Minnesota; they aren't likely to part with any of their young talent due to them being in the midst of a rebuild with the only notable exception being the currently floundering *Talen Horton-Tucker.  That said,* THT is himself making a not insignificant $11 million & thus is hard to truly consider a centerpiece of a Collins salary dump.  Plus, it's an open question as to whether the Raptors front office still have any interest after the past two seasons of terrible THT play in the Mormon state.

There is one notable obstacle to any sort of salary dump for John Collins.  That would be the aforementioned GM of the Jazz, Danny Ainge.  There are a few teams and/or GMs the Raptors and/or Masai Ujiri/Bobby Webster have never traded with & Ainge fits the latter for Masai/Ainge.  Not only that but Ainge is notoriously stingy when it comes to trading draft picks; like Masai Ujiri he has never traded more than one first round pick in a single transaction though it should bear mentioning that Collins contract likely won't require more than that as compensation.

As interesting as either one of Utah's two movable 2025 picks may be due to their respective team's unique circumstances i.e. Mitchell being unlikely to re-sign with Cleveland & the Timberwolves tax woes-to-be making it likely they will have to make trades in the near future, the Raptors being more likely to prefer players over picks does make a move with the Jazz far less likely than some of the other names on this list.  Additionally, Utah's team is in a bit of a weird state where they could be buyers or sellers at the deadline given how good they've been of late and how valuable some of their roleplayers may be to a contender.

*TL;DR - John Collins is a standard bad contract for an okay player on a team that might not be incentivized to move him...yet.*

**Davis Bertans (Sort of)**

Unlike the previous two examples, Bertans isn't really worth noting as a player even if the former two weren't exactly great to begin with.  He's a non-shooter who got paid to shoot in Washington, he doesn't bring anything useful as a player & while he is overpaid, he functions as a semi-expiring as there is an early termination option that comes with a $5.3 million guarantee.

For both the Thunder and any team that involves Davis as a trade piece, what can be included with him is more of note than Bertans himself because said team still has to a) either waive or buyout Bertans and b) either option will include paying the 2024/25 guarantee.

For draft capital, take your pick.  Literally.  Whether it's one of their 4 2024 firsts with varying protections and quality, their tetra of 2025 firsts and no shortage of swaps or picks from L.A., not to mention a slew of seconds that could be highly valuable from aging cores currently in contention, there is no shortage to attach to Davis' contract.  It is dubious that they would be willing to attach one of the more valuable picks, however, given how lightly protected the Rockets 2024 first rounder is, and barring a collapse from the 76ers their 2025 1st isn't likely to be all that valuable.

With the number of picks & guaranteed salary the Thunder have along with the general roster crunch they experienced over the summer, they are more likely to move some of their current draft stash, albeit they may choose to defer their draft choices by moving their current selections in to a later draft a la moving a 2023 1st to acquire a 2029 Nuggets first rounder that is far more likely to be of value than the one they gave up.

As far as young players go, the most obvious name is *Ousmane Dieng*.  Unlike the Jazz who are in the midst of a rebuild, the Thunder may be more willing to part with one of their young players, namely due to Bertans being the only notable piece of salary filler they have on their relatively inexpensive roster to upgrade their team, & Dieng is the obvious non-draft pick Oklahoma could include given his place in the rotation has been suspect unlike other rookies/sophomores such as Jaylin Williams or Cason Wallace, neither of whom are likely to be available.

Dieng is an interesting player.  I wouldn't call him good - he's fallen out of the Thunder's rotation for reasons we'll get in to -  having only played 22 games off the bench this season, and in fewer minutes than he did in his rookie season.  That said, he has an interesting combination of size & skill as a forward.  At 6'10 with an enormous 7' wingspan and a surpassingly fluid handle for said size, the former 11th pick in the 2022 NBA draft has a lot of potential as a two-way wing, & at 20 years of age he has plenty of time to make - and learn - from his mistakes to reach his ceiling.

The key word is potential.  Ousmane has a bad habit of shirking from contact & despite his incredible size & fluidity, he lacks aggression on defense; this is part of why he has a paltry 7 blocks to his lengthy limbs, not even coming close to an average of once per game with 0.4 blocks per game in his rookie season.  Did I mention he's yet to get a single block in his sophomore season?

He also has a habit of losing track of his man but that's unrelated to the lack of blocking or stealing even when given a leash.  The other issue with Dieng is the complete lack of outside shooting.  This was a problem dating back to his draft days & while he's seen a slight uptick in his 3-point shooting in both the G-League and NBA proper, going 30% on less than 1 attempt per game is uninspiring, to say the least.  Their shot form isn't broken or anything, he's just not making his 3-pointers which, again, is why he's more likely to be on the move than the hot-handed rookie Cason Wallace.

Still, Dieng does have one major point in his favor:  For his size, he's an excellent passer that, although the assists may not jump out at first, could thrive in an offense than benefits from smart players who need to make quick decisions on the fly such as the 0.5 offense the Raptors are utilizing.  A 6'10 playmaking wing is a valuable archetype on its own.  The fact that Dieng can be all that & more if given a proper runway makes him one of the few young forwards that could fit in to a Raptors retool around BBQ if made available in a trade.

*TL;DR - Bertans is the choose your own adventure novel equivalent of trade pieces.  There is a deal to be made & he doesn't eviscerate a team's future flexibility but his ETO is a penalty all the same.*

**Richaun Holmes (Also sort of...but not really...but worth ment-look we'll get in to it momentarily)**

Fun fact:  Holmes was one of the centers we were rumored to be interested in during the last season the Raptors had any notable cap space (2021, aka. post-Tampa).  Regardless of how negotiations fell apart, the lack of signing seems like a blessing in disguise as unfortunate injury after unfortunate injury & an ugly custody dispute that involved allegations of child abuse & domestic violence from his ex-wife that we don't have a ton of time to delve in to have made Holmes a player wholly lacking in trade value.  Needless to say it's not a surprise why Sacramento dumped him on the Mavericks in the 2023 draft.

Here's the problem with picking Holmes as your bad contract trade target:  Even if one sets aside what one chooses to believe regarding the allegations (said allegations resulting in a defamation lawsuit against the outlet that first reported on them & the court ruling in favor of Holmes for custody are not evidence in of itself of no wrongdoing on his part, but in terms of overall evidence, we aren't privy to the finer details of said allegations unlike, say, the very well known & public evidence of Miles ""man who should absolutely be in jail & out of the league"" Bridges &  thus have only word of mouth to rely on; at the risk of derailing this section, I will say I believe the allegations are true but with the custody dispute over & no investigation into said allegations of abuse following the now settled lawsuit, we aren't likely to find out the specifics), it needs to be noted that the Mavericks are very unlikely to want to give up any of their young players or their sole movable first-rounder in any deal at this year's deadline - & that's just about the only way to convince any team to add the backup to Dwight Powell & a rookie Lively to their roster.

One needs to understand that Dallas needs to simply wait until the offseason before they have far more flexibility in shoring up their team:  If the Mavericks currently owed 2024 1st conveys to the Knicks in this year's draft (Top 10 protected), that gives them 3 first-round picks they can attach to Holmes' and/or another player(s) salary, & it is worth noting Richaun is an expiring deal in the 2024/25 season with a player option he's absolutely going to take.  Dallas might not have a prime package to get another star next to Luka when their best young player \[who is available; Dereck Lively is more or less untouchable at this point\] but they could use their combination of newly freed up draft capital, contracts & young wings in *Josh Green* & *Olivier-Maxence Prospe*r to bolster up the roster with quality roleplayers rather than risk Luka's dissatisfaction leading to a trade request.

Much like Utah's Ainge's lack of trade history with Bobby & Masai doesn't preclude the possibility of a trade between the two, there isn't anything to fully eliminate the potential of a panic trade.  Between the [looming fear of Luka wanting out of Dallas](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-luka-doncic-trade-request-rumor-fear-mark-cuban) & the team currently in the play-in race, they may have to make moves with what they have.  What they have right now isn't nothing but much like when they were up for consideration as a Siakam trade partner, they don't have the most appealing of packages.

Right off the bat, the sole first rounder they have access to in 2027 is hard to see them parting with given the aforementioned possibility of Luka wanting out, at least not with some notable protections.  The Mavericks do have potentially useful seconds in the Raptors own 2024 2nd & a Miami 2nd in 2028, but beyond that, their draft capital is sparse for the moment.

Though their young players aren't the most exciting names, they do have some potentially decent fits next to Barnes.  *Jaden Hardy* is suffering from a sophomore slump - down from a hot 40% from 3 to 35.5% on less than one more attempt per game compared to his rookie season & in general less efficient from the field compared to last year - but he's equal parts affordable an option at the 2 if one is planning on moving Gary Trent Jr. & handles the rock decently as a tertiary ballhandler off the bench.  His defense is unimpressive, however & on a team whose defense has fallen off of a cliff, he's not the most ideal roster addition.

Speaking of slump, the recently extended *Josh Green* is not having the best season following said payday.  While his 3-point shooting has quietly climbed back up to around what he shot last year, his general offense outside of taking & making 3s needs work & his defense, once a strong point of his, has also boarded the S.S. Regress & unlike his 3-pointer, his defense has not come anywhere near close to where it was a season ago.  It's by no means atrocious - he's still a better defender than Jaden Hardy but it's not unfair to say that Josh has failed to follow through on his proclamations of stepping up for the Mavs defensively.

While Hardy & Green are known entities, the 2023 rookie that Sacramento gave to Dallas when dumping, Olivier-Maxence Prosper is all question marks.  O-Max was drafted for all the sort of qualities that the Raptors are known to love.  He's a lengthy forward with versatility on defense but underdeveloped offensive capabilities.  Prosper did shoot well from the line in two of his three college seasons - 82% & 73.5% in 2021/22 & 2022/23 respectively - but how well that will translate to the NBA or his skillset in general is hard to say; the 2023 rookie has played less than 10 minutes per game across 25 games & this include a stretch where the Mavericks were both banged up & in need of someone stepping up to keep their season afloat.

It's hard to read too much in to what little he's played in Dallas as even the far more promising Dereck Lively has had his struggle with playtime due to Jason Kidd's notoriously inflexible rotations that prioritize playing their veterans over any promising young talent on the team.  It is worth noting that Prosper is one of the few known players that had a workout with the Raptors but how much interest they have in him at the moment isn't known.  It certainly wasn't enough for them to make a move on draft night to acquire him but who knows what deals, if any, fell through or if the Mavericks managed to nab him before a deal with another team was meant to be pulled off.

Regardless of who one might be interested in, none of them are intriguing enough to consider them a steal if one manages to get any one of the three - & it's only one of them, there is no world in which the Mavericks part way with any more than that, if only because the Raptors are already strapped for roster slots without waving players - along with Holmes who'll more likely than not resume his benchwarming duties that he assumed in Dallas.

*TL;DR - Richaun Holmes is an option for a salary dump in theory but in practice Dallas may opt to make moves in the offseason & they don't have the most appealing players/picks to include in any deal.*

**Killian Hayes**

So as said, there aren't a lot of obvious examples for a salary dump.  A season or two ago, Fournier & Bertans were the go-to guy but it's gotten to the point where calling one of the few examples, that being calling Killian's final year of his rookie contract bad, is a stretch.  He's essentially an expiring & while he could be made an RFA, there is neither an obligation nor justification to extend Hayes a qualifying offer.

As bad as Killian has been overall, he's both young & not without his points of redemption.  Notably, he's a decent defender & can handle the ball acceptably as a 2nd or 3rd string guard in the rotation.  As a primary/secondary ballhandler in one's starting rotations?  One only has to look at Detroit's current record to see how that has gone.

That being said...$7.4 million is a still a lot of money for a borderline NBA player one would be taking a flier on, especially when the Raptors have another reclamation project in Kira Lewis Jr. & while any team picking up Killian isn't going to foot the entire bill for his salary, they do have to pay a not unsubstantial amount for a player who is likely to be out of the league come next season.  The Pistons don't have a ton of draft capital to spare outside of a useful second rounder from Washington that is going to fall somewhere in the top 3 of the 2nd night of this year's draft but again, with Hayes' status as a salary dump candidate being questionable, it's hard to see Detroit including anything of note; even said valuable second rounder might be pushing it given the Spurs are allegedly interested in the distressed asset of a PG that is Hayes.

The one interesting thing to note about Killian is that his salary would fit in nicely to the Raptors $10 million-ish trade exception & could potentially be used as a part of a larger trade to open up another trade exception in a similar manner to the O.G. trade exception opening up said $10 million exception as part of the Toronto Raptors.

*TL:DR - It's Killian Hayes, I refuse to elaborate.  Emphasizing the L in TL;DR.*

**Conclusion**

There you have it.  With the Raptors prioritizing flexibility in what looks like a weak free agency class, the possibility of them taking on any of these players isn't altogether likely but it shouldn't be a surprise if they decide to make use of their many expiring contracts in about a week's time.

Whether that's to take on bad money or make marginal moves to shore up the roster with what assets they do have remains to be seen.  As for who could possibly be up for consideration for the latter, we'll touch on that next time."

As you might have heard, the Raptors have recently traded away Pascal Siakam and there's multiple veterans of theirs who are expected to be on the bloc. Let's go over them and the likelihood they're traded come February 8th, going from the most likely to the least likely of the remaining players.

**Bruce Brown**

https://preview.redd.it/gydz8llyoaec1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=495ec1fb7b87fd63ab6dd1e3afe8ca2bcbf6e0ae

*23/24 Stats (so far): 12.1 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 3 APG (in Indiana)*

*Shooting Splits: 47.5/32.7/81.7 (in Indiana)*

I've already talked about how [Brown is not likely to remain a Raptor for long](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/19af8ys/an_belated_breakdown_of_the_incomplete_pascal/) and while there has been some news that the Raptors are open to keeping him if the right offer isn't there, it is abundantly clear that the former Nuggets champion is in demand and not lacking in suitors.

The most commonly noted names are the Knicks and the Lakers (the Mavericks have also been mentioned recently with a package presumably including Richaun Holmes), both of whom can technically meet the reported threshold of the Raptors for a return on Bruce i.e. a [""quality player"" and a first](https://marcstein.substack.com/p/the-latest-from-nba-trade-season-48a), only one of whom can do so in practice because the Knicks have a plethora of firsts and at least 2 young players they can include with Fournier's expiring contract (Grimes, Sims) while the Lakers first would be way down the line in 2029 and the players constituting salary filler to make the trade work would have to include D'Angelo Russell (Rui also works but D-Lo is the more likely of the two the Lakers would prefer to move). Given the quantity of calls the Raptors received, they aren't likely to need to settle between the two and we'll likely hear more names come up in the weeks leading up to the day Brown is moved...

...unless that offer never comes.

This is the part where we have to acknowledge that, for as likely as certain players may seem like they're on the move, there is no guarantee that Toronto will say goodbye to any one of the players that has or will be mentioned. That said, of all the players the Raptors are likely shopping around, Bruce Brown currently remains the one who's most likely to be bought. At this stage, it seems like it's only a matter of time given the multitude of suitors that keep coming up.

*Likelihood of being traded: Very high*

**Dennis Schröder**

https://preview.redd.it/zuozbzh2paec1.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=744d155756da5076d5e0311357cf185c9b32e63a

*23/24 Stats (so far): 13.9 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 6.3 APG*

*Shooting Splits: 45.1/35.9/85.8*

Ordinarily, a recently signed player would not be on this list; it's generally considered bad business and, even if Toronto isn't known for attracting free agents, it makes it all the more difficult to build a roster when one can't even sign a complimentary role player. Barring said player requesting a trade/being dissatisfied with their role/minutes (see: Brown who was reportedly not happy in Indiana) or causing issues with the team that moving them becomes necessary, first year signings are rarely moved to get any value for them to accumulate assets for a retool, rebuild, etc.

However, between Schroder's remarks about the culture of the Raptors, separate comments hinting at dissatisfaction with a bench role on the Raptors, coupled with rumors of him [not liking playing behind the starter Immanuel Quickley](https://x.com/thedunkcentral/status/1744575403472158894) and Dennis' name coming up frequently in the reports for who is available...it's not hard to see why Schröder could be gone the same season as his signing, and on mutual terms at that.

Dennis is a good point guard. Arguably, he's the best free agent signing the Raptors have ever had though saying that is an acknowledgement of how low the bar has been. Ideally, the bag fumbler is suited to a bench role despite his higher aspirations but he can function as a starter for a team in desperate need of a ballhandler and he's more likely to be amiable to a lesser role on a team that's more suited to the playoffs. One might not get a valuable first from him but a swap and salary/a potential flier could be in the cards depending on how desperate a team is in need of upgrading their backcourt.

*Likelihood of being traded: High*

**Chris Boucher**

https://preview.redd.it/vg0buuq7raec1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9204b39009d466c656f6efa0ff3fdddc907c11c7

*23/24 Stats (so far): 6.1 PPG, 4 RPG, 0.4 APG*

*Shooting Splits: 47/33/75*

On paper, Boucher should be an easier player to trade than he will be in practice. Both [Blake Murphy](https://hoopshype.com/2024/01/21/raptors-very-likely-to-trade-chris-boucher/) and [Michael Grange](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/19d8bfa/michael_grange_with_a_raptors_rumour_update/) spoke with confidence that Chris won't be on the Raptors come February 8th and his name has popped up at prior deadlines for a reason. Whatever else can be said about Boucher, he plays with a ton of heart.

In practice? Similar to Siakam, he's a bit of an awkward fit on a lot of rosters. An energy big with streaky shooting, he's always bringing capital H hustle off the bench and remains a solid rebounder despite living up to his nickname of ""*Slim Duck*"". He's good at what he does but not every team is built to have a place for an energy big with questionable 3-point consistency off the bench and unlike Dennis or Schroder where one can make a reasonable assumption what one would have to give up to acquire them, it's less clear for the former G League MVP who is one of the few examples of development success stories the Raptors have had post-2019 and thus the organization may find themselves reluctant to trade him compared to Bruce and Schroder, neither of whom share the same history with Toronto.

The other issue is salary. Not necessarily for the Raptors - their $10 million-ish trade exception actually makes it very easy to make the money work on their end and the opposite team can send out less than that if they simply want to match the minimum under the new CBA - but for other teams who might be considered suitors. The Celtics were reportedly interested in Boucher but they are incapable of making the money work, as one example.

In theory, Chris' contract shouldn't be too hard to match - it's actually a fair value of a contract given his salary declines in his final year - but his $11.7 million isn't as easy for potential suitors to scramble together the necessary ballast to balance the outgoing with the incoming. With the Raptors having limited roster slots without waiving some of their expiring contracts, the proposition of dead salary coming with a player they like is unlikely to be seen as appealing.

There's also the less tangible considerations to consider as to why Chris is less likely to be moved. It's often mentioned that Boucher is the last piece of the 2019 championship team and while that's mostly done in jest, Boucher is a a remnant of the culture from that particular era of Raptors ball. He grinded his way in the G League on to the team's rotation, becoming the G League MVP the same year as the championship. The Raptors haven't had a lot of development success stories since winning the title outside of Scottie Barnes and while Chris isn't some supreme bench piece, he knows his role and he plays it quite well. As mentioned earlier, Boucher's overall trade value isn't as clear cut as what one could get for Bruce or Dennis and thus it might be seen as better to retain that remnant of a winning culture rather than give him up for a protected 2025 second or the like unless he's combined with Schroder or another player we'll touch on to match the money on a larger salary player(s).

https://preview.redd.it/rpzk6in4paec1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=861a8141730ac49c1c7f6099b573caadc20b46b9

All that being said, there is a reason why Blake spoke with such authority: If ever there was a deadline where Boucher was going to be traded, now would be it. It isn't as likely as Brown or Schroder, but it cannot be ruled out that the team will move the final player from that 2019 team and one of the players who best embodies the grind and development of the ""We the North"" Raptors run.

*Likelihood of being traded: Medium*

**Gary Trent Jr.**

https://preview.redd.it/otaxcvf5saec1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1bcc083638e8294113299dc68f8c32f4895de1b

*23/24 Stats (so far): 11.5 PPG | 2.1 RPG | 1.6 APG*

*Shooting Splits: 42.5/41.7/65.1*

You might be surprised to see Gary at the bottom of this list. I'm surprised there is any debate.

Gary Trent Jr. has become very divisive amongst Raptors fans after a very poor start, continuing his bench woes from the post-Poeltl 2022/23 Raptors but to get straight to the point, Gary Trent Jr. is not seen as very valuable on the trade market right now, regardless of where you stand on him in the short or long-term of this team. While he's been significantly better as of late, the perception of Trent has not caught up with the player he's been i.e. people think his shooting has fallen off of a cliff when he's roughly 42% for the season so far which, on 5 and 1/2 attempts per game, would make it his best season from outside overall.

In addition to this public perception that opposing front offices will share and thus will likely lowball the Raptors for him, all the other guys on this list have at least one more year on their deal even if they may not be eligible for an extension like Dennis would be in the offseason. Gary is both expiring and unable to receive a lengthy extension with his new team until the postseason which could make him a flight risk depending on the destination and who he'd end up playing with.

Gary's name being in this year's rumors isn't a surprise; the Raptors have always had this awkward, at-arms approach to Gary, never really treating him like he's part of the core or at the very least like he's part of this team's future i.e. Masai and Bobby rarely mention him in pressers when the team was Pascal and Fred's, Gary's name has come up more than once in trade talks - albeit one of those was Dallas asking for Trent and Dragic plus our 2022 draft pick in exchange for Tingus Pingus who was injured at the time - and despite the front office being impressed with Gary's professionalism last year, said professionalism has yet to secure Trent Jr. an extension in Toronto despite the [initial report from Chris Haynes](https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1674962497256951808) suggesting the deal was close to being finalized last summer.

https://preview.redd.it/eu44959traec1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bc7e95cddc27015821bd4c3136de9ab9d695399

To be sure, Gary hasn't played himself in to the contract his camp purportedly wants. He certainly has not seen the sort of progression that one would hope from the young sniper. He has gambling issues on the defensive end, his finishing hasn't gotten much better since his first season with the Raptors and he's certainly not on the level of player that Norm Powell is, let alone was at the time of the trade.

However, Gary has gotten better in smaller ways and, more important than that, the player that he currently is fits well alongside Scottie Barnes and he helps to open up the floor for him in the paint. Their two-man DHO was one of the more effective plays last season and while it hasn't been a go-to of Darko's offense with Trent and Scottie this year, Gary might be the biggest beneficiary on the whole from Darko's offensive system and especially from the improved spacing in the post-O.G. era of the team; as of January he's been [shooting a scorching hot 52.1% from 3](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/gary-trent-jr.-january-2024-3-point-percentage).

Wile he's still prone to ballstopping in the Raptors free-flowing offense and frustrating finishing at the rim, he's demonstrated a greater willingness to pass the ball/shot up even if it doesn't show in his assists. He's still streaky at times but even in games where he's cold, his presence helps to space the floor because opposing teams have to respect his ability to get hot at the snap of one's fingers.

Gary is a good player and one whose frustrating moments can make one overlook the value he brings, be it off the bench or to start games. He's in that spot where he's more valuable to the Raptors than he is for what he can bring in because, simply put, what he can bring in won't be all that valuable due to those aforementioned factors of being an expiring contract that people think of the player from November. Say what you will about the Norm Powell trade at the time being done to get value out of Norm before the front office worried they'd lose him, it was a bet on youth (and let's be clear: Gary Trent Jr. at 24 years old is a better player than Norm when he was that same age) that hasn't yielded a player better than Powell. Trading Gary a younger player doesn't make sense for either team because the team trading for Trent is probably going to value a rookie scale contract more than they are the opportunity to pay Trent Jr., and the Raptors aren't going to feel like they're getting value from Gary when they could simply re-open negotiations and re-sign Trent Jr. for 2-4 more years.

Speaking of rookies, there has been some debate as to whether Trent being moved could free up minutes for Gradey Dick but there's no reason to treat Trent and Dick as if it's a choice between the two. If anything, having both on the roster can open up some interesting small ball lineups with Scottie at the 5 and surrounded by snipers or snipers-to-be if one believes in Gradey Dick. This Raptors team is already lacking in talent - specifically talent that can shoot - and selling low will not rectify that barring a homerun trade where one combines his salary with one of the picks the Raptors received from the Siakam trade to bring in a better player. All it will improve is this team's inability to convert on the good looks that Scottie is able to generate for less capable floor spacing teammates.

A lot of this equation does change if Trent has changed his mind on staying a Raptor, however. If Trent or his agent are now opposed to him staying in Toronto and/or they refuse to reopen extension talks (since if I understand it correctly, Trent can still sign one unless he goes to a new team via a trade before the deadline), let alone sign an extension then at that point the only thing one would gain from him walking is cap space. A second or two is a bad return, but at least it's better than betting on the Raptors historically poor free ability to attract even above-average to middling free agents in the midst of a retool.

Beyond this being a weak free agency class, there isn't any one player that can be pointed to as a Trent replacement. Nic Claxton matches Barnes' timeline better than Poeltl but he isn't as fluid a passer as Jakob is and Nic isn't putting up 3s to stretch the floor like Gary does, ditto a nostalgically tantalizing reuniting with DeMar in his twilight years. Paul George is probably staying in L.A. and if he is on the move, it would be for the equally cap-having 76ers.

The closest names that come to mind for a ""New Gary"" is Malik Monk who seems prime for the Pistons or another desperate to egregiously overpay him as the Kings lack his Bird Rights. KCP is another alternative but given he's on a perennial contender in the Nuggets and plays a key role in Denver, his departure is highly unlikely. And it should go without saying but the aging final years of Klay Thompson are as unappealing for Toronto as it is for Klay, irrespective of the Warriors dynasty's dying days.

https://preview.redd.it/kovzm6j9raec1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c2b32c756685dadf5982d9cdad4325f7f2fb9d6

But again, this all changes if his looming free agency is a distraction and an extension isn't secured prior to this upcoming deadline. There is still time for that to occur but regardless of the specifics, Trent leaving for nothing is not something that affords a lot of opportunity to retool the roster in free agency and thus you have to get something out of him while you can. Whether it's traded for him directly or it involves using Gary's expiring salary and attach draft capital to acquire a player on a long-term deal, the alternative is not viable.

Still, he's on here for a reason and while I think he'll be here to stay, it would not surprise me if Gary won't be a Raptor for much longer.

*Likelihood of being traded: Low*

**Other notes:**

* As Thad Young and Otto Porter Jr. function as a $14M-ish expiring, the two can be used to take on some salary for additional draft capital or take a flier on a young player; the immediate trade that comes to mind is sending the two to the Mavericks for a salary dump of center Richaun Holmes or the the Thunder for Davis Bertans who, though technically an expiring, his ETO requires a minimum penalty of $5 million next year
* Nwora and Lewis can't be combined so their individual salaries of $3 million and $5.7 million respectively would need to individually match up with any incoming player before one factors in attached draft capital for X or Y player"

* Schroder was a good signing in a vacuum - the problem is that these decisions don't exist in one and this team is going to have a gaping hole at the PG position in a few years when - and this is assuming Dennis isn't traded or leaves next year - Schroder inevitably declines unless the plan is for Scottie Barnes to eventually shift to the PG position
   * This is yet another issue with the roster construction:  Veteran talent is certainly important to cultivating a certain culture but while the team overall isn't ""old"", there's a fair amount of key players who will likely have declined by the time Scottie Barnes reaches his prime
      * Yes the FO can make moves to retool around Barnes between then and now but the clock is ticking as Scottie's extension talks will be coming this summer
* An aside:  I get that he's the lead PG but Schroder's touches have skyrocketed and he should not be 1st or 2nd on a given night

**On Darko:**

* Evaluating if a coach is doing their job is really hard
   * There's a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes we're not privy to and there's only so much criticism one can get for a rookie coach - especially with the talent he has on hand
* The 0.5 offense at the very least seems to be a system that the players have bought in to though the results of that...we'll get in to it later
* There are some weird concerns that are starting to crop up, namely some odd comments (and no i'm not talking about him saying he likes hands) and poor rotations
   * The ""4 bench, 1 starter"" lineups generally don't work, mostly because of the overlapping skills of the bench forwards and the starting forwards, and the lack of ballhandling in those lineups
   * Darko saying to ""have fun"" when the team is down by double digits to the Spurs is...not encouraging when trying to build a winning culture
* Darko is doing the best with the roster/talent he has...which is to say...

**On the bench**:

* It's still bad; for scoring alone, the Raptors are 2.2 PPG separate from the worst bench
   * At the time of their 20th game's conclusion they were the [8th worst bench in scoring](https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/188xndn/the_raptors_bench_is_23rd_in_points_scored_per/)
   * This is actually worse than last year's bench since they're getting more minutes and roughly the same level of productivity
      * The bench is shooting a paltry 32.7% from 3
* It looks better when you get in to the individual players...but not by much
   * Precious has picked up the intensity on defense of late but he's still chaotic and inconsistent on offense
   * Gary Trent Jr. is having the worst shooting season of his career, notably being sub-60 percent from the free throw line and 36.4% from 3
      * Sidenote:  This team is dead last in free throw percentages and everyone aside from Scottie Barnes & Dennis Schroder is on a down year shooting
   * Chris Boucher has quietly been a sniper...on the less than 2 3s he's been taking though he's one of the few bench players who've gotten less minutes but he's still making some of the same silly mistakes on defense you've come to know and love Boucher for i.e. biting on the pumpfake deal of the day
   * Jalen McDaniels has been so bad I almost forgot he was on the roster until Darko squeaked him back in to the roster and then I remembered it took him 5 games to score a single field goal
   * Thad Young's corpse is still on the team

**On Malachi Flynn**:

* Malachi looks more confident, his shooting is...still not amazing but it's at least there in theory and he isn't shying away from letting the ball fly
* The defensive intensity has been notable from Flynn and he's been playable on that end
* Flynn has definitely improved as a backup PG...but you'd still take someone like Nembhard or Mitchell (the PG one) off the bench over him

**On Gradey Dick:**

* He's played 13 games
* ...And he hasn't looked great in those games?
   * He does a lot of the little things you like to see, his passing has shined in quite a few moments under the 0.5 system
   * But the shooting has been bad and Dick is amongst the lowest in field goal percentage and it looks like it's affecting his confidence i.e. afraid to shoot
* Did I mention it's only been 13 games he's been fielded?
   * He's played more games than Jarace Walker who was taken earlier and hasn't even cracked double digits in games played
   * Like Walker he's spent several games in the G League of late and he looked great in the most recent game
* It's way too early to call Dick a bust but considering the impact other rookies in his range have had on their teams (Keyonte George, Jordan Hawkins), one can't help wish his impact was as immediate at those two

**On Siakam**:

* Look...we all know the front office wants to trade him
* They tried to trade him (The Pacers and Hawk had packages which ultimately fell through due to the lack of commitment to an extension from Siakam) in the offseason
* They are likely going to be making calls to trade him closer to the deadline
   * Sidenote:  It's not Siakam's job to get a good return for Siakam in a trade and Bobby Webster is at fault for not being decisive at last year's deadline/on draft night
* It almost feels pointless to talk about a player like Pascal who I don't even expect to be on the roster but his 3-point shooting being a career worst 19.8% when factoring in how many more 3 point attempts he has compared to his rookie season at a touch over 4 per game
* Other than that, Pascal is doing Pascal things and he's gotten better as the season has gone by, mostly by way of his touches going way up

**On Scottie Barnes**:

* Similar to Siakam, it feels almost pointless to talk about Scottie Barnes because we all know and have seen his improvements on offense and defense
   * His shot looks more smooth and he's far more comfortable taking 3s, and it's resulted in a career-high 38.2%, and at around 5 attempts per game, that's pretty impressive
* He's still not perfect on defense i.e. faster guards still get by him but in general his help and 1-on-1 D are stellar
* His playmaking is just as poignant as always, which is what makes it a shame no one seems to be able to convert the good looks he's generating them
* His aggression is still a bit of an issue but when he's on (or it's the 4th quarter), he is playing some beautiful bully ball in the paint

**On the record**:

* 9-11 is not as bad when factoring in opponents and there have been impressive wins in there such as the recent win against the Suns
   * That said, against 0.500 teams, the Raptors are a paltry 5-9
* Ugly losses to the Bulls and Blazers would probably give a more positive outlook on this team and its future
   * The problem is they lost those games and we're 9-11 instead of 11-9
* This team has a bad habit of digging themselves into a major hole in the first half for them to dig out of in the 2nd
* A similar record to last year or slightly better (42-45 wins) seems like it's possible...
   * But since Siakam is most likely gone (and with the recent rumors about the Raptors being worried about O.G. it's possible he's traded too), the team is unlikely to achieve that level of success, which wasn't particularly high of a bar to accomplish in the first place"
120,Which late first rounder from this draft class is most likely to surpass expectations that the Raptors should take a flyer on?,This is Bobby Webster btw
121,An overall look at the Raptors' Pivot season,"This season, the Raptors came in with a pretty clear goal of looking to the playoffs. We had a number of all-NBA guys, brought on some steady-hand vets and our new starting PG in Dennis, who was fresh off of a finals MVP performance in the FIBA world cup. 

Pretty quickly, we realized that it wasn't going to work quite how it was drawn up, and we blew it up. The Raptors made an absolutely enormous roster swap, and the team is essentially completely unrecognizable from where it started the season. I wanted to take a look at all of the trades together, as one, and discuss A) what objectively happened, but then B) how we feel about it overall.

So, let's start with the objective. Here's a full list of trades we made this season, presented as one single trade. Note that I'm not going to include items at all that we didn't retain (for example, that first round pick we just traded to Utah or Kira Lewis - we didn't have them before the season, so it functionally ""doesn't exist"" here).

&#x200B;

|Assets Out|Assets In|
|:-|:-|
|Pascal Siakam|RJ Barrett|
|OG Anunoby|Immanuel Quickley|
|Precious Achiuwa |Bruce Brown|
|Malachi Flynn|Jordan Nwora|
|Dennis Schröder|Kelly Olynyk|
|Thaddeus Young|Ochai Agbaji|
|Otto Porter|Indiana's 2024 first round pick (likely \~16-22)|
||Indiana's 2026 first round pick (protected 1-4)|
||Detroit's 2024 second round pick (almost certainly 31st pick)|

&#x200B;

So, as compared to the beginning of the season, what does this series of trades do for our...

**Free Agent Situation:**

Before the season, we were entering a pretty worrying situation: Pascal, OG, and Gary were all in contract years, and with Scottie being an obvious max contract when his time comes, we probably didn't have the money to keep everyone satisfied. Pascal obviously was going to want the max, and it's likely OG would as well. Gary was and is quite a bit more up in the air, and certainly wouldn't be pushing for max, but if we would have tried to sign all three of our impending max contracts (including Scottie), there wasn't going to be much left over for Gary if we wanted to staff the rest of the team with non-vet minimum guys.

At this point, we're in a much better place there. RJ is locked in long-term, and although some folks might think he makes too much, I'm here to say that in a few years, we're going to think his contract is an *incredible* deal. To give perspective here, a max contract is 35% of the cap, and right now, it appears that the prediction for next season is that the cap will be around 141 million. This would mean that a max contract would sit at nearly 50 million a year. RJ will make 25 million next year. By the end of his contract, RJ will just be entering his prime at 26 years old, and he'll be making peanuts compared to what he likely should be making at that point - we have New York to thank for that one.

Our free agents that matter at this point are Gary and IQ. IQ is the question mark - I personally don't have a read on his value, and I don't know what kind of contract he's going to get. Gary's is even more up in the air - he feels like a total toss up. It seems he didn't have much of a market at the deadline, and I suspect that the rest of the season is going to be an important time for his value. Right now, I suspect that he might opt for a shorter-term team-friendly deal - he seems to like Toronto a lot, and as people have recently noted - his role has been all over the place recently, and he's not complained a single time about it. That level of professionalism should be rewarded, and I personally hope we keep him around on a 2 or 3 year deal. 

Kelly is also expiring this year, but his last contract was very cheap - 3 years, 37 million. I suspect we will be able to do something similar and keep him around long term if we like what we see to close the season. Jordan Nwora makes next to nothing (3 million this year) and is also expiring; I suspect that if we like him, it will be very easy to retain him cheaply. Bruce Brown has a team option for 23 million, which as Bobby Webster said is a very ""interesting"" option. It means that he's tradeable in the offseason, keepable, or, if for whatever reason we need to, completely dumpable, too, if we simply don't pick up the option.

What this all means is that even though we have more relevant free agents, our situation for retaining them is much more flexible and better than it would have been - having to negotiate around two max contracts while still leaving space to max Scottie soon and *also* handle the rest of the team would have been very difficult.

**Draft Situation**

This one's a quick one. We got much better. It's completely up in the air whether we retain our own pick this year, and Bobby et al. have made that direction no clearer - he essentially confirmed that they chips will fall where they may, because the real key here is going to be seeing how this group grows together, no matter the outcome. So we won't talk about that pick - it's completely up in the air.

For the rest, we went from having quite literally nothing - no second round and possibly no first - to having one first this year and the best possible second round pick, as well as an extra first round pick in 2026. This is an obvious improvement all around, and gives us lots of flexibility both within the draft and for other trades (now and in the future with the 2026 pick). 

**Overall Roster Construction**

Well, we got younger, and we're really banking on youth to take us to the next level, just like it did way back in 2016 and onwards. I get the sense that Masai is aiming to construct something akin to the original bench mob here, although we're not quite *perfectly* aligned there. 

We have lots of young guards now: An obvious starter in IQ, but then Ochai and Gradey as promising young shooting guards to develop as well. Jordan Nwora and Jontay are still reasonably young as well in the forwards/bigs department, but I suspect they're always going to be backups. We have an incredible pair of young forwards already in Scottie and RJ, and so really the only positions that we're missing young prospects are really at the center position (RIP Koloko) and at the PG spot - both places that could be potentially ""solved"" in the upcoming draft, or through some off-season trades, much in the style of the Ochai trade.

We have tons of *non-pg* playmaking to help compensate for the lack of PG, although whether it will actually make up for the lack of a traditional backup PG is a good question.

On the defensive end, we have Scottie, Brown, and Ochai who will be leading the charge there - and everyone else has lots of learning to do. Gradey has shown some promising defensive effort, if not all-around skill. It was very encouraging to watch him taking some charges earlier in the season, and I've liked his effort here recently. RJ and IQ have some learning to do here, but I think they're willing defenders - they just need coaching. Right now, though, I think this might be the biggest area of growth on the team - everyone needs to buy in defensively, and that probably doesn't happen over night, unless Ochai really is transformative there (and I'm hopeful!). I suspect that we're going to be a pretty open basket for the rest of the season.

Our shooting is quite good, though - if you compare to where we were last season, we have many more shooters now, and with time, I suspect that our offense is going to really be what carries us in our wins.

**Overall**

I think in general, we've done as good a job as could be expected with the ""unexpected"" mid-season pivot. Having to ditch your two best players to suddenly build for the future is a hard job, and I think we've done a pretty excellent job with it. We have lots of potential here with our young core, and from a salary/FA/Contract perspective, we're really in a much, much better place than we were before. We're not going to be playing for a championship this year, certainly, but I think this set of moves really does a pretty admirable job of setting us up for the near-term future. If we manage to shore up our depth in the PG and C position with some promising youth, I really like our potential for the next few years. 

What do you think?"
122,"Why would a "" fan"" start a petition to get rid of Massai and Bobby?","Was scrolling through my Google feed this morning ( hope everyone had a good day yesterday for those who celebrate Christmas) and came across the most outlandish change.org petion to fire both Massai and Bobby. 

I couldn't even find a tag for humor in this sub. But figured everyone could use a laugh the way I just got one after reading this.

2019 seems so far away, but these are the 2 men that put that championship team together. 

Inaction can be frustrating but WHY do 135 people (at the time) think that the best way to win again is to get rid of the persons that got you there?  Some franchises have never even made an ECF let alone WIN a championship. The NBA is hard and getting harder to win (new luxury tax rules, massive contracts, shorter competitive windows, bad injury luck) as I mentioned before I just found the write up hilarious.

123,An Belated Breakdown of the (Incomplete) Pascal Siakam Trade,"Well...as one announcer said to another during Vince Carter's legendary Dunk Contest performance, ""It's over, ladies and gentlemen"".

Pascal Siakam is no longer a Raptor and while there will be plenty of time to reflect on his unique legacy for what he meant to Toronto for his incredible development story and his key part in the team's first championship.  For now, let's talk about the trade and what was received.

In return for the All-NBA forward, the Raptors received...

* Bruce Brown
* Jordan Nwora
* Kira Lewis Jr.
* 3 first-round picks
* A $10 million-ish trade exception

Let's go over each one, shall we?

# Bruce Brown

https://preview.redd.it/mqhtf47yacdc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bb874ce701eced9c13136fc6d34d1b38f72a11

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  12.1 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 3 APG (1.2 turnovers) on 47.5/32.7/81.7 shooting**

Bruce Brown is not going to be a Raptor for long.  Aside from an awkward ""Rasheed Wallace on the Hawks"" game or three, all points indicate he will be moved to another team and his presence in the rotation will be temporary.  As such, it feels almost pointless to talk about his solid defense, his deceptively good shooting (look up how well he hits 3s from the right corner) or his glorious facial hair.  

The way I see it, there are three routes that Toronto can take in an eventual BBB trade:

**1A is for assets**:  You've probably heard about the Knicks being interested in Bruce Brown and they're not the only team.  Brown is a playoff-caliber player with plenty of experience from his time in Denver and given his contract has a very team-friendly option in, well, his team option for the 2024/25, it makes him valuable for a contender who might be willing to give up a pick(s) or young player who they don't have time to develop.  On his own, Brown has enough interest that he can probably fetch a first-round pick on his own, a young player, a swap or potentially a combination of the three depends on how desperate certain teams may be to make a playoff push.  Most recently, the Knicks came up as a potential Brown suitor with a presumed package based around Evan Fournier's (more or less, it's a team option) expiring contract.  Whether they come with a swap, a pick or the currently being shopped guard Quentin ""You is not him"" Grimes is besides the point which is to say that Brown's value alone makes this trade somewhat incomplete.

**Press 2 for Help now**:  We'll touch on the other assets that were received in the trade and potential moves to be made but while Brown cannot be aggregated with other players, he can be included with draft capital in order to acquire a player(s) that the Raptors are interested in to get Scottie Barnes some more immediate help.  They're obviously not going to land Lauri - especially not when we dive in to the picks they got for Siakam - but 3 additional picks can allow the Raptors to make some use of their currently unused bench salary as well as Brown's own semi-expiring contract (It has a team option).

**Dial 3 for salary relief**:  Because of how much he's making over the course of this season, roughly *$22 million*, Brown offers an option to take on a larger salary in the form of a bad contract that might up the return in the short or long run; the first one that comes to mind is Ben Simmons who a) the front office has been interested in for some time and b) is on a massive deal for 2 more years and c) is on a team that can offer compensation in the form of a forward via one of their two 2023 rookies (Noah Clowney or Dariq Whitehead) or a pick in the 2025 draft.

Other ""bad contract"" names to note:

* Andrew Wiggins
* Jordan Poole
* John Collins
* De'Andre Ayton
* Evan Fournier\*
* De'Andre Hunter
* Davis Bertans\*\*

^(\*Fournier's final year is a team option with no penalty for declining)

*\*\*Davis Bertans has an early termination option for 2024's offseason of roughly $5 million*

I've also seen some suggestions that Lowry or Chris Paul are bad contracts but while they are making a lot of money, they're also an expiring contract unlike the trio of Wiggins, Poole and Ayton, to say nothing of John Collins contract.  Hunter in particular is a name to keep an eye on as there were reports of the Raptors being interested in him - though how much stock one wants to put in to this as reflective of the Raptors intentions now as opposed to one or the other team sharing this in order to to drum up interest from other teams is up for debate.

While it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Raptors keep Brown, it makes more sense to move him to a contender or pretender willing to provide something that can help the Raptors out with their ongoing retool.

*TL;DR - Bruce Brown is less worth considering for what he brings to the team and what he'll eventually be moved for.*

# Jordan Nwora

https://preview.redd.it/32kfv31nccdc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b7b8ae5627ba3d91b206fb44e691048acb121b

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  5.2 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 1 APG (0.7 turnovers) on 45.1/30.6/81.8 shooting**

Look, Jordan didn't play tonight so it was either this or a photo of him guarding a Raptor while on the Pacers/Bucks.

For those that like to complain about the length of my posts, you're in luck!  There's barely anything to say about Jordan Nwora.

Nwora is a player who should be better than he is.  A 6'8 forward with some shooting chops and a 6'11 wingspan, he showed some promise in Milwaukee on the offensive end with a then-career 3-point percentage of 40.3%.  His defense was not stellar but at the very least he gave the Bucks a mild scoring option off the bench before being traded away as part of a deal to bring in Jae Crowder.

In Indiana, his 2022/23 was more of the same; with more minutes (Going from 15 a night to 25 in the same season) and therefore opportunities, Nwora showcased his 3-ball with higher attempts and the same relative efficiency from outside the arc with

The same cannot be said for his most recent season.  Whether one wants to pin this on a reduced role in the rotation due to Rick Carlisle's firm coaching tactics/emphasis on defense or a general slump, Nwora's main selling point is at a career-low in both attempts (2 per game) and makes (30.6% for the season), and while he might find a new role in Toronto, it does not bode well for him if he isn't able to carve out a spot in the rotation for a team still in serious need of bench scoring now that Gary Trent Jr. is back to starting.

In fact, I would describe Nwora as a slightly larger Gary Trent Jr. with notably worse defense.  Say what you will about Gary gambling on steals, at least he's trying.  

Jordan, on the other hand, has the size to be a good defender but routinely fails to put in effort on that end of the floor, his shooting is streaky and while neither are willing passers, i'd say Gary has at least shown a greater desire to stop chucking up tough shots and pass his way out of them, especially as of late.  Jordan is not a terrible player by any means and at the age of 25 his trajectory is not set in stone but he's shown little improvement to his overall game and when one and a half of those seasons are in an ideal spot for him to grow i.e. a young core with a rising superstar in Tyrese Haliburton, it's hard to put much stock in to Nwora growing any further than he has with the Raptors.  He's a low-risk, low-reward player that might help space the floor but his ineptitude on the other end of the floor will almost certainly make it difficult to give him consistent minutes short of a paradigm shift on defense, especially with the far younger Gradey Dick having more upside in a similar role as a flamethrower off the bench.

*TL;DR Jordan Nwora is a flier on a low-level player who isn't likely to become more than a bench player - if he even cracks the second unit's rotation at all.*

# Kira Lewis Jr.

https://preview.redd.it/i0a9spt6gcdc1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a7a7c4dc5765ec1e73f5bd0caa065381f1ac39

**2023/24 Stats (So far):  2.9 PPG, 0.9 RPG, 1.2 APG (0.5 turnovers) on 30.8/10/90.9 shooting**

Second verse, same as the first for the picture though unlike Jordan, it would be a genuine surprise if Lewis played a second for Toronto because despite boasting the lofty drafting pedigree of being a 13th overall pick, Kira has been nothing short of a disappointment.

Part of that is due to injury; he tore his ACL after stringing together a few decent games in November 2021, tearing it early in December when facing the Nuggets which cut his time in said game - and his sophomore season - to a close.

Part of that is circumstantial; being on the Pelicans, Lewis had to play behind point forward Zion, lead Lonzo Ball and - when they acquired him - Tamper Master CJ McCollum who's been relegated to the lead point position, all of which led to a lack of opportunities for Kira in New Orleans.

Mostly...he's just not good.  He's comparable to Malachi Flynn in that he's a short PG who has shown some capability of being a rotation-caliber player though he has a more notable burst to his first step.  That said, he's not good at orchestrating the offense and it's only a slight exaggeration to say his scoring capabilities are genuinely worse on his best days than Malachi's were on his worst.  He isn't a strong defender, he struggles to finish at the rim and while he doesn't turn the ball over that much, he makes enough mistakes on both ends that it's hard to truly afford him any opportunity unless one's intention is to lose games.

Kira Lewis Jr. can only barely be called an NBA player and even then, it's a case of following the letter of the law because he very rarely shows a reason to give him time on the floor short of injuries sapping one's team of their more capable or promising players.  It may very well be unfair to fliers to to call Lewis one because of how low a chance it is he'll even be in the NBA come next season, as he's shown nothing substantive to warrant a second contract.  It would be a surprise if the Raptors put forth a qualifying offer barring a miraculous turnaround.

As an aside, it is both amusing and infuriating that Pacers somehow managed to ***get*** draft capital for the honor of rerouting Lewis to the Raptors when Toronto is the one paying the remainder of Lewis Jr.'s salary...and probably not much more than that unless Lewis manages to salvage his career and become a quality rotation player - something he was unable to do with Dyson Daniels taking his spot as the backup point in his rookie season.  At the very least, the Raptors made use of the exception from the O.G. trade so they could create a slightly larger exception that we'll touch on in a bit.

With Schroder potentially being on the move at the deadline along with Brown, Lewis Jr. might get some more opportunities to show off but he's given little reason to be hopeful that he'll make the most of it.  Put another way, it's not a great sign when the most notable contribution a player brings is an exception to potentially bring in another, better player.

*TL;DR Kira Lewis Jr. has had flashes of being a capable player but is best treated as a flier unless he can show something he failed to in New Orleans.*

# A Quick Summary on the Players

The fact that the two young guys who've been included with Brown have so little upside is what makes this trade so frustrating.  Regardless of what Bruce can bring back or the drafted players, the fact of the matter is Nwora and Lewis are low upside players who might not even manage to take a spot in a rotation that could soon become in need of a backup point guard and is currently in need of greater forward depth after trading away Siakam and O.G.  Neither of them scream future All-Star or even start-level player and one of them 

# Draft Capital

This is where the most of the contention of this trade comes from i.e. whether the Raptors got ""a haul"" for an expiring Siakam: The draft picks the Raptors got back.  To be sure, 3 first round picks is not nothing...but a closer examination of those picks should serve to illustrate that not all picks are created equal.

**Pacers own 2024 pick** (Currently tied for 19th) - Top 3 protected

**The worst of the Thunder's 2024 picks (OKC's own or the Clippers)** \- Unprotected

**Pacers own 2026 pick** \- Top 4 protected

While the season is far from over, right now those 2024 picks are looking to be at the back half of the draft, with both likely to end up in the 20s barring extended away time from Tyrese Haliburton or an injury to more core players.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the urgent push for the Siakam trade was to help keep their season afloat so they didn't need to rush Haliburton back from recovering in order to make the playoffs as the Pacers are notoriously anti-tanking/pro-competing every season.  And with how bad the worst teams in the league have been, landing in the Top 3 to keep said pick if the season goes downhill is not an option.

If the playoffs were to happen right now, this is what the Raptors would be looking at without worrying about what would happen to their own pick in the lottery:

https://preview.redd.it/tywp0mswabdc1.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f4dc492a87388b99f901f5fb5abd33c1b1a24c

How you feel about the draft capital coming the Raptors way depends on whether one is confident the Pacers will re-sign Siakam and how much one likes the players in this draft since the Raptors now have 3 picks in the 2024 NBA draft - four if they keep their own first which is currently 7th in lottery odds.

The Raptors certainly don't feel too strongly about it, or at least they didn't until more recently, given they traded out of this draft to acquire Jakob Poeltl.  The 2024 draft has garnered a lot of comparison to the 2000 NBA and while there were 3 All-Stars in that draft, they were all one-timers with one of them being regarded as ""the worst All-Star ever"" in Jamaal Magloire.  The 2000 draft still produced several good players but when compared to your average draft, not a single one of them stands out as  a franchise changing talent even if one were to assume Kenyon Martin or Hedo was playing in today's NBA.

While i'm very much in favor of keeping our pick, it's with the explicit acknowledgement that said pick is more valuable to help build around Scottie right now i.e. get a rotation level player either through the draft or trade it to get someone who fits that description, rather than waiting until 2025.  I haven't done a deep dive into the draft but while there are a few players i've taken a look at who have some level of intrigue to them, very few stand out as having starter level upside or higher.

Beyond the level of prospects one has to look at, drafting 3-4 rookies is a very unlikely scenario so it's very unlikely all the 2024 draft picks will stick around, which is where the one notable positive can be given to the acquired draft capital.  Bad picks or not, 3 of them is nothing to sneeze at and even a bad draft can see the team make moves leading up to it; even the 2000 draft saw teams like the Magic make use of what draft capital they had in smart trades (albeit the smartest thing the Magic did was draft the Rookie of the Year via trading down to get him plus future draft picks in a stronger class).  What player a team could be lured by either of the 2024 draft picks that would be of interest to the Raptors is not known at the moment but it is worth noting the Raptors have a slew of expiring contracts in Otto Porter Jr., Thad Young, Bruce Brown and Gary Trent Jr. that could be very easily have a  first attached to them for some help off the bench. 

In the off-chance no deal is made in the coming weeks, here are some names to note that could fall in to the range the Raptors could either draft without further moves - or by trading up/down to acquire fitting talent for their current roster's weaknesses:

* **Tyrese Proctor (G)**:  Despite this being a pretty guard-heavy draft, there aren't a lot of them in the Raptors expected range that are particularly noteworthy or at least ones that would fit what the Raptors are looking for in their guard rotation.  Tyrese Proctor is the exception, a score-first guard who can make his own shot but isn't afraid to pass the ball if a better shot can be taken.  Also he's *Australian*.  Shrimp on the BBQ.
* **Justin Edwards (F)**:  Believe it or not, Edwards was seen as a potential candidate for the 1st pick in this draft.  The fact that he's a player who could be in the 18-35 range should tell you how his college season has gone.  He's...not consistent, to put it mildly.
* **Tidjane Salaun (F)**:  Masai was recently spotted scouting in France and this was the player he was presumed to have his eye on.  A big win who's very raw as a prospect but has a ton of defensive upside and sports terrific athleticism at the wings.
* **Kel'el Ware (C)**:  A center who was originally expected to go in the 2023 draft but went back to college to improve his draft stock after a disappointing college season...which he has not.  Ware's potential is intriguing as a modern big man but the flashes he's shown lack consistency and his free throw shooting is at odds with an admittedly hot hand from 3 (on very low volume).  With Koloko being waived and his career in potential jeopardy, a backup big could be a significant need for the team; at 6'10, Jontay Porter is slightly undersized to be banging in the paint with the biggest centers in the league despite his recent success propelling him to start for the team.
* **Ryan Dunn (F)**:  One of the best defensive prospects, he mainly lacks the 3 part of ""3 and D"" wing archetype that's so widely coveted in the league.  He's an advanced stats lover's dream.
* **Zach Edey (C)**:  I'm not going to list every center in this draft because outside of Alexandre Sarr and Kel'el Ware they're not interesting as prospects but Zach is at least worthy of being mentioned.  He was expected to go undrafted in the prior 2 drafts and returned to college both times.  Now, he's a potential late first/early second and he's one of the most dominant players in college basketball...albeit he's a bit slow footed and not particularly mobile at 7'4 and nearly 300 lbs.

Beyond trading up, down or out of this draft leading up to the first or second draft night, there is one other interesting scenario to consider:  Be it Brown, Boucher or another player, the Raptors could make a subsequent move to swap the worst of the Clippers/OKC 2024 pick with another team to increase the position from where the Raptors will draft and could either let them more easily secure one of the above names or nab a player not listed that may have gone earlier and thus would not have been selected.  The Rockets did this same thing last year and moved up a whopping 10 spots(!) which let them select one of the steals of the 2023 draft in Cam Whitmore.

Some teams to keep in mind for a potential swap:

* **Rockets**:  You've likely seen the news but if you haven't, there's some speculation that the Rockets - due to Ime's relationship with Bruce - is a prime candidate to land him and they do have easy salary matching in the form of Jeff Green and Victor Oladipo.  It is unlikely they'd give up a swap for the Nets pick given it's projected to be 8th in the draft at the moment, however, unless it came with some protection and given the Rockets signed Fred away in free agency, the Raptors may be inclined to do business elsewhere.  Oh and no they probably aren't giving up Green...nor should the Raptors want him, Jalen Green is bordering on bust territory.
* **Pelicans**:  No, you aren't going to get a swap for the Lakers pick they own if it's in the lottery but you might be able to get the worse of those two picks, which is closer to the early 20s than late.
* **Suns**:  It goes without saying there's no way to match Brown's salary in Phoenix but Boucher's name was commonly thrown around in 2022 when there was apparent interest in the Raptors trading for Ayton.  Additionally, the new FO has been swap happy, to the point where they swapped the same pick twice to shore up their few assets.  That said, the salary matching becomes significantly more difficult since it would likely have to be centered around Nassir Little's $6.2 million salary and, more concerning, they are in the play-in race which may dissuade them from swapping this year's pick given one bad game could land them in the lottery via the play-in tournament
* **Knicks**:  Fournier's contract was already mentioned but apparently Quentin Grimes has been made available and, if the O.G. trade was any indication, there is little to fear about James Dolan vetoing the trade for the pettiest of reasons
* **Heat**:  Lowry's expiring contract has been the go-to trade target for a lot of big time moves involving Miami along with picks and some of their young guys but it would make for a bit of an awkward reunion were Miami to simply dump him back in Toronto with a swap after he contributed to two lengthy postseasons for the Heat.

*TL;DR - 3 picks is a lot and some of them could be used to make immediate moves but the quality isn't there between the lateness and the weakness of this draft.  The 2026 pick could be something depending on circumstances.*

# Trade Exception

I'm going to keep this to its own pseudo TL;DR because this team rarely makes use of the trade exceptions they generate.  They didn't do anything with the one created by dumping Dragic, they didn't use the one we got by trading Chris Bosh and while $10 million isn't a small amount of money, there aren't any bad contracts that come to mind for said exception to absorb and it's not like the Raptors have any free roster slots at the moment to bring one in by simply using their recently acquired draft capital.  The trade exception is interesting on its own but in practice it's unlikely to see use though at least the Raptors don't need to use it immediately i.e. they can carry it over to the offseason and part of the 2024/25 season.

# Other Considerations

* Between Bruce, Nwora and Lewis' expirings, the likes of Trent Jr., Otto Porter Jr. and Thad Young being on the final year of their deals, coupled with the various cap holds/rights that would allow the Raptors to free up cap space, Toronto could be looking at upwards of $30 million before factoring in the MLE to fill out their rotation; chasing after LeBron is unlikely to happen even if we draft his son with one of our picks but this isn't the worst free agency class to add talent for free\*
   * Names to note for the 2024 free agency class:  Nic Claxton (Nets), Buddy Hield (Pacers), Saddiq Bey (RFA for Hawks), Jalen Smith (Pacers), DeMar DeRozan (Bulls) and Jonas Valanciunas (Pelicans) for a good ol' Raptors Reunion™, Malik Monk (Kangz), Kelly Oubre Jr. (76ers), Mike Conley (Timberwolves), Patrick Williams (RFA for Bulls...but please no)
      * It would be very funny if we somehow landed O.G. or Siakam but the chances of that are so unlikely that it barely warrants mentioning
* With the Raptors pick being so lightly protected and the high difficulty of catching up to the Blazers for the 5th odds when Portland has the 2nd most difficult remaining schedule, expect to see more minutes of Gradey Dick with the team because holding 6th will be a challenge in of itself with the Grizzlies being tied in odds with us at the moment
   * Note:  This section was written before the Grizzlies recently reacquired the 6th best odds in the lottery
* Now that the trade is done and over with, there is no more uncertainty about the team's direction and, more importantly, in the locker room; last year's deadline was full of Raptors names in rumors  and the players knew that some of them may be on the bloc.  It no doubt affected their performance and while there are likely further moves to be made, it is likely a relief that they no longer have to worry about what will happen to the former #1 option on the team as the FO makes like a father in July and commits to BBQ.
* **KOLOKO WAIVED**
   * While there is a lot of speculation as to what will happen to Christian, this is a significant blow to the Raptors center rotation even in spite of Porter's making the most of his starts for the past two games.  Even if he's re-signed later on or signed to the G-League, the Raptors will probably need to grab a backup big or potentially a center who can grow in to a starting role as Jakob ages.  For now, it's a surprise to see Koloko be waived and the retaining of the older players on the roster may suggest another deal is in the works that may require the expiring salaries of Thad Young or Otto Porter Jr. (Temple is probably sticking around, it's not like he's making all that much).

# Conclusion

I wanted to give myself some time to both process the fact that Siakam is no longer a Raptor and to evaluate this trade as fairly as possible without my immediate reaction clouding my judgement because, needless to say, that reaction was not one of thrill and excitement.  For most fans, it was disappointing to see Pascal go and even moreso for the package he went for.

No Walker.  No Mathurin.  No Smith.  Not even Ben Sheppard was sent our way.  Just 3 picks of dubious quality, one good roleplayer and two players who will be lucky if they become roleplayers half as good as Bruce Brown.  The fact that O.G. Anunoby and Jrue Holiday - both technically exprings as their respective player options are expected to be declined - got their respective teams more of what could be described as a haul despite Pascal being a better player than both only makes this look all the worse at the moment.

What this trade this most reminds me of the Vince Carter trade, in that it was the culmination of an awkward affair between a player and their front office, and a disappointing return of players/picks given the talent being sent out that was the definition of trading for pennies on the dollar.  It was a move that both signaled a new era is upon us and that said era was not going to get any immediate help for then ascending superstar Chris Bosh...though thankfully Bruce Brown suited up unlike Alonzo Mourning.  

To be clear, this trade isn't anywhere near as bad as the Carter one was, if only due to this front office being a very different one than the old front office that botched the relationship with Vince in the first place and far more capable of savvy drafting as opposed to the one that passed on two future All-Stars who were selected right after their respective busts in consecutive drafts.  

That said, Bobby Webster and Masai Ujiri are the same people at the helm who are responsible for a lesser offer than what could have been worked out if they were more decisive instead of desperate at the prior year's deadline to keep together a core that clearly wasn't working. While one can certainly empathize with how difficult a decision it must have been to move on from Pascal Siakam, it is not an absolution from criticism with how they handled both the trade and the final offseason with the team's All-NBA forward - the very same one who saw the writing on the wall with ""SCOTTIE"" in big red letters and still suited up to play for the team he had already sacrificed so much for, even if it meant taking a reduced role in a contract year for a player who, although on a rapid rise, is still not quite on his level.

Even if one puts aside the hindsight goggles. Even if one acknowledges the emotional weight of this decision.  Even if one understands the sentimentality that informed this trade of Masai doing right by Pascal via sending him to a team he wanted to go to, there is not a single piece in this trade that one can feel immediately good about.  Bruce Brown is a good player but he's both not expected to be here long nor is he on the same level of player that Pascal is, and he doesn't come with Bird Right to ease the uncertainty of re-signing him in 2025.  Neither Lewis nor Nwora seem like they'll be capable of cracking an adequate team's rotation and the draft capital, while plentiful, is unlikely to yield a player as good as Pascal nor a roster as deep as the championship team he won his first ring on....not for a few seasons at least, if ever.

For the Pacers, this is an absolute swindling of a deal.  For the Raptors?  It's incomplete for now but even with a homerun trade for Brown, it's not looking too great - and with the lengthy endeavor that was the teambuilding around DeMar, it does make me wonder how long it will be before this team will be competitive once again with the rising star that is Scottie Barnes."
124,Raptors have been equally as hard to watch this year as last so far..,"&#x200B;

Raptors fans, buckle up because last night's game was a tough pill to swallow. I can't help but feel a stark contrast to the joy I experienced with last year's team. Instead of witnessing a cohesive unit, it felt like I was watching a flock of sheep donning lion masks. The lack of chemistry was glaring, defensive matchups were a disaster, and the reluctance to take charge, especially when Scottie has demonstrated the capability, was infuriating.

Let's be clear, this isn't an isolated issue with one player; it's systemic. It's high time to hit the reset button and start afresh. The disheartening reality is that we seem to be regressing into a season reminiscent of our darkest days. We're out there playing a version of basketball that can only be described as positionless, with players seemingly clueless about their roles and how to execute them. It's mind-boggling that individuals earning hefty paychecks can be so passive on the court.

If this were a conventional workplace, and in essence, it is a professional setting, stern warnings about the need for heightened production and focus would be in order. We'd be talking about potential changes in staff to shake things up. It's like seeing a cut that needs immediate attention before it festers into an infection.

I get that this might sound raw, but as a devoted fan, I can't hide my disappointment. I'm reaching a point where I'd rather go back to watching CJ Miles throwing bricks or DeMarre Carroll struggling but still hustling because, at least, they showed effort. Tonight, facing the Suns, are we in for a spanking? It's highly probable, although we tend to elevate our game against tougher opponents. Perhaps this is the moment when the guys will finally show up.

But let's be real, it might be time to embrace the tank. Bobby Webster, your time might be up, and maybe it's time to trade the whole roster, with the exception of Scottie, who should permanently assume the role of the second option. Let's not even mention Max; his unwillingness to take over and be 'the guy' is getting old.

As frustrated as I am, I can't help but rally the cry—LET'S GO RAPTORS!? Yet, it's becoming increasingly tempting to say, save your breath."
