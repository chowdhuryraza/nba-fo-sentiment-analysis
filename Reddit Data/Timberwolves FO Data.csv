Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

21,"[The Athletic] Tim Connelly, Timberwolves reach an agreement, ensuring he will stay in Minnesota","Full story on the Connelly situation that adds a bit to what was reported in [Shams’](https://x.com/shamscharania/status/1798181660019564821) and [Jon K’s](https://x.com/jonkrawczynski/status/1798182441913364499) tweets.

Some noteworthy tidbits:

>The Detroit Pistons loomed last month as a potential suitor for Connelly, and the Timberwolves were bracing for Pistons owner Tom Gores to make a lucrative offer that would have been difficult for them to match. But **when the Wolves beat the Nuggets in the second round, the Pistons decided to move forward in hiring Trajan Langdon** from New Orleans rather than wait for the Timberwolves to be eliminated before approaching Connelly.

>Even with the ownership issues, Connelly’s preference was to stay in Minnesota. That includes the possibility of **signing another long-term deal after the ownership situation settles,** team sources said.

>**All indications are that both factions of Wolves ownership are open to paying the luxury tax to keep the team competitive.** For now, Taylor has the final call on any moves that are made or not made, an authority that will likely extend through the draft and free agency while the arbitration unfolds.

>Everyone below the principals involved in the fight has been caught in the middle of it, and now Connelly will play a major role in keeping them focused on the team so they do not let this season’s leap forward go to waste. He has already been successful on that front. **Before the season ended, senior vice president of basketball operations Matt Lloyd turned down a chance to take a higher-paying position in the Charlotte Hornets front office** to stay with the Timberwolves, team sources told The Athletic."
22,[Borman] A recap of Tim Connelly’s 2023 so far:,"- Traded D’Angelo Russell for Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and SRPs
 - Signed Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels to five-year extensions 
- Re-signed Naz Reid, NAW
- Brought in Shake Milton, Troy Brown Jr. 
- Traded up with SRPs from the D’Lo deal to select Leonard Miller in the second round 
- Drafted Jaylen Clark (consensus FRP before his achilles tear) late in second round  

Pretty remarkable work."

29,Tim Connelly is a genius?,"He built the Nuggets into a team that could win a championship, left the year before they won but his fingerprints were all over that championship.

He then went to Minnesota and made an insane trade everyone clowned at the time. I think he pretty specifically built the Timberwolves as a team that could take on Denver (obviously the series has just started, and Denver could easily take this series still, but it's clear that the Wolves can at a minimum hang with Denver). 

This is getting a lot more conspiratorial, and I don't fully believe it, but there is a small part of me that wonders if he partially made a big trade like that to inflate the trade market, forcing other teams to pay up the nose for players they perceive as better than Rudy. Like do the Suns have to give up as much for KD if not for that trade? Do they have more depth and can hang with the Wolves? Pretty far-fetched but let me try and cook a little bit :)

Then he makes the trade of Dlo for Conley, NAW and 2 second round picks?? An absolute killing imho. Dlo was basically addition by subtraction on its own, and then you put in a great veteran steadying presence like Conley, a top-tier 3 and D guy in NAW and 2 seconds? 

Other little moves here and there you could maybe quibble with but the big moves have been fantastic, especially in hindsight."

33,"Even if Lore and A-Rod don't buy the Timberwolves, their decision to hire Tim Connelly may have saved the team from relocating.","For the longest time, the Timberwolves were an absolute mess and not a lot of fans showed up to games. 

I believe that the Marc Lore/A-Rod helped build a winning culture from top to bottom with the Tim Connelly hire. The Rudy Gobert trade and the Mike Conley/NAW trade helped change the trajectory of the franchise, which in turn increased fan interest, and proved to the NBA world that Minnesota is in fact a great market that's worth investing in. 

Even if Taylor finds new owners, I think they'll keep the team in Minnesota because the fanbase is reinvigorated, and that wouldn't have happened without the groundwork done by Lore/A-Rod."

Amen."
37,"Tim Connelly: “Without Chris Finch, I wouldn’t be here.”","TC was on Mike Rand’s podcast episode today. Around the 28 minute mark, but the whole interview is well worth a listen."
38,We need to have an honest conversation about Jaden McDaniels...,"He hasn't quite developed into the player he should be, which is a consistent 12-15ppg wing who can defend. The gap in production between Jaden and guys like OG Anunoby, Josh Hart, Herb Jones, and Lu Dort is notable.

He's a pesky defender, but my god Jaden's offensive game is not where it needs to be for a guy making the amount of money he's making. If the Wolves want to go from good to great, he needs to be a factor on offense or Tim Connelly should consider trading him."
39,I hope we keep KAT,"I know this is a pretty low effort post, but I think he's better than Julius Randle and Lauri Markannen. KAT might not be the best fit for a defensively focused team, but it would be cool if he played his whole career with the Timberwolves unlike Garnett and Love. KAT might be the best 3pt shooting big in the history of the league. It's pretty rare nowadays for a player to retire with the team that drafted him without ever leaving, but I think that would be great if KAT got the chance to do that. Nevertheless, I'll try to trust that Connelly knows what he's doing."
40,"[Statline] Such a slept on acquisition, the king of AST/TOV ratio",This trade has been amazing. Love the energy Monte brings as well as his basketball IQ.
41,Ownership tells you they will not pay the luxury tax and you have to get below the 2nd apron—what’s your move?,"Before I even begin to dive into this post, I just want to say I’m so thankful for the wolves and the excitement they brought this year. I’m with Tim Connelly 100% that my top choice is to run it back. But TC also said ownership has the final say and he will make moves accordingly if he is told to do so. So my question is, for all of my fellow salary cap nerds, what would you do if you were TC and you were told to get below the 2nd apron to avoid the luxury tax? 

The elephant in the room here is clearly KAT. His new supermax kicking in is what puts us over the edge. So my thought is, unfortunately, if we need to reduce salary then he is the first place to start. I don’t want to give up cheaper pieces like Jaden and Naz because they match Ant’s timeline. I also don’t think you get a return for Rudy that makes a ton of sense for us given his cap hit and age. 

My suggestion: explore a trade that essentially swaps KAT for Trae Young or another young, dynamic scoring point guard that matches Ant’s timeline. Trae young will be slightly cheaper than towns moving forward, and this would push us toward our cap goal.

The hawks have made it clear they will trade Young for the right price. They have the #1 pick, and even in a weak draft, this could be their best shot to hit the reset button and build a contender from scratch. If you rope in a third team that wants KAT and will send picks to Atlanta (likely a rising team with draft capital in a similar position to where we were with gobert 2 summers ago), then a three-team deal would make a lot of sense. 

I think KAT is better than Trae today, so maybe you get back a good young role player or a decent pick too. But I’d like to hear any other pivot options. A starting lineup of Trae, Ant, Jaden, Naz, and Gobert wouldn’t be half bad, and Dallas proved you can make it to the finals with two elite guards (assuming Ant continues to develop into a top guy like Luka). "
42,Glen Taylor Mouthpiece ,"Wolfson is essentially just speaking for Glen Taylor anymore. Said Taylor is better for Wolves fans short term. Also wondered if Tim Connelly is getting too much credit. Keeps repeating he doesn’t know if the board of governors will approve Lore/ARod/Bloomberg even if they win arbitration.

Jon K & Dane Moore never seem concerned about the new owners being okay with being a 2nd apron team. Why is it that Wolfson & Souhan (Startrib) are the only media saying it’s better if Glen stays I wonder?"
43,"24-25 Wolves, What Improvements Do you Want To See?","I wrote this off the top of my head.. so sorry in advance for anything stupid. What are some specific improvements you'd like to see from any of the wolves players next season?

Rudy Gobert	
- this might be a case of teaching an old dog new tricks, but it would be awesome if he would get softer hands. He's been working in that Euro step, so we know he's still working on his Offense. Maybe more one dribble quick offensive moves/pivot post moves?

Karl-Anthony Towns
- I'm not sure if we'll see much many different opinions here. Keeping a steady mentality and not picking up stupid fouls. This always seems to snow ball. He'll feel that he's been slighted or treated unfairly and immediately does something silly and picks up a foul or turns it over. Beyond that, some athleticism in his drives and playing better team defense. He goes full speed head down on drives way too often. He can get by the first defender but ends up in bad situations after that. Euro, jump stop to two step, pro hop, jump stop step back 10 footer. Low post moves?

Josh Minott	
- consistent jump shot and adding some lbs 

Naz Reid	
- offensive consistency. It seems like we.knowmright away whether or not it'll be a nice Naz night or a slower night. His offense always seems to bleed into his defense where he might get into foul trouble/TOs if his shot isn't going.

Anthony Edwards
- playmaking, fitness, offball offense and defense. Limit turnovers and get that apg closer to 7 would be amazing. Coach Finch mentioned focus at home being a bit lacking. This wasn't directly attributed to Edwards, but it was after a night when he had a slower game. 

Leonard Miller	
- defense, strength, finding a way into the rotation.

Nickeil Alexander-Walker
- obviously his shot lately hasn't been falling, but we know he can regularly knock them down. He spends a lot of energy on defense, so it's understandable why his non catch and shoot offense is a little lesser. There were a lot of times where I thought he could have made a move to the rack instead of settling for a close out 3. Other times he did make a move to the rim and was blocked badly. Handles. Consistent bench scoring is a huge need (possibly partially addressed with Dillingham, but we don't know)

Jaden McDaniels	
- in the words of Anthony Edwards, if Jaden is scoring, the wolves are winning. Similar to NAW, handles, finishing strength, consistent 3pt shooting. If he can develop his own ~~shit~~ shot creation like he had at Washington, watch out. 

But definitely need to watch out for unexpected shit creation too. Haha, damnit.

Mike Conley	
- not sure what else we can possibly ask of this guy. 

Joe Ingles
- we know he has great playmaking, nice shot, familiarity with Conley and Rudy, decent size, but he's getting older so guarding might get tough. 

Luka Garza	
- quicker feet and decision making, pivot post moves, lower body strength to give another defender for the wolves to throw at dominant centers might help him get on the court.

Rob Dillingham	
- I think the hope is that we get good to great bench scoring and playmaking year one. 

Terrence Shannon Jr.	
- I think the hope is that we get defense, athletic slashing and finishing, maybe some shot creation and consistent catch and shoot 3pt jump shooting.

Jesse Edwards 
- two way, not sure we can expect much

Daishen Nix
- two way, I think Daishen could be interesting if he can figure out defense and how to use his weight/strength. I think he's closer to 6'5 than 6'3 and doesn't have great length. It would be amazing if he can take a step and find out how to guard stonger perimeter players that destroy the Timberwolves.. Zion, Luka. NAW and McDaniels tend to get tossed aside or easily screened off without being able to recover. Wolves need a strong bulldog type defender who isn't Edwards. Beyond that keep the team hyped and come up with more demoralizing bench celies.

PJ Dozier
- not sure we can expect much from PJ. This will likely be one of his last chances. PJ did end up with some starts with Denver when Mal Murray was hurt a few years ago. He did ok with those minutes. Timberwolves/any team can always use more combo guards. Tim Connelly should know PJ well. He just hasn't quite bounced back after getting hurt a few years ago. 

Jaylen Clark
- two way, assuming the wolves would like to just see him play a bit. We saw one nice summer league defensive game from hima and I think there's a lot of hope around him that he can take the step to be a regular rotation player. Maybe a Josh Okogie type dude who can knock down open looks and absolutely clamp dudes."
44,Paying the 2nd apron for 1-2 years is not the end of the world. ,"Some of my friends were fretting over the 2nd apron and said the Wolves are ""borderline crippling their future"" because of it. Investing in a championship contender (or a team who can make deep runs at the least) is huge for Ant's development and will make him a better player in the future. Is it just me, or are people really making it seem like the end of the world? It's not. Yes, I say this even with them possibly repeating in the 2nd year.

In broad terms, 2nd apron means you can't use the MLE, combine salaries in trades, and it freezes their draft pick 7 years out if they want to make a trade. But if a FO is locked into the roster and want to improve through internal development and continuity, they aren't looking to make big trades and sign FAs with the MLE anyway. Whether that is a good idea is to be seen.

If they're in the 2nd apron *for 3 years,* then it also moves that draft pick 7 years out to #30. I think they'll avoid the 3 year repeat since Conley's 2 year contract ends and they can sign Rudy to a longer, cheaper deal or let him go.

Once they are out of the 2nd apron (say after 1-2 years or in 2026), the MLE and trade penalties don't hold anymore -  can go back to combining salaries or using cash in a trade and can use the MLE again. I really think people are making it out to be the end of the world when it's not (esp if it's just for 1-2 years). Plus, Wolves FO just brought in Michael Bloomberg, the 13th richest person in the world and **the ownership groups** [**said on record that they are committed to paying the tax for 24-25** ***and beyond*** **if Tim Connelly recommends that.**](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/big_investor_to_join_wolves_ownership_group_led_by_marc_lore_alex_rodriguez/s1_14822_40451288)

Almost all championship contending teams pay the 2nd apron, this is not unique to the Wolves. My motto has been to sit back, watch the fun basketball and let the GMs do their job. If a year from now, Tim Connelly believes paying the 2nd apron for another year is a good idea and the owners said they are committed to do so, then great! What's the problem? Just enjoy the fun basketball, it's been a long time coming for us."
45,Robert Dillingham 2023-24 Season Highlights,
46,The DLo for Mike Conley and NAW trade is the finesse of the century,All hail Tim Connelly 🫡🫡🫡
47,[Moore] Connelly says Dillingham will be in the rotation from Day 1:,https://x.com/danemoorenba/status/1806184485223878842?s=46
48,Wolves rookie Jaylen Clark (who ruptured his Achilles in March ‘23) posts video of himself in full speed 5 on 5 scrimmage,"Pretty much no chance (or need) for him to be ready to play games this year, but exciting to think the Timberwolves will be adding a former Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and finalist for the Naismith Men's Defensive Player of the Year to this already stacked defense. 

Clark was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 13 points, six rebounds, 2.6 steals and 1.9 assists in 30 games as a junior. He finished sixth in the country in steals per game, second in defensive box plus-minus (plus-6.7) and 12th in defensive win shares (2.7).

Tim Connelly: “We’re super excited about Jaylen Clark. We had him as a high first-round grade all year. Unfortunately, he had the injury. We think there is no better wing defender in the draft. I think he brings an aggression, toughness and intelligence that allows guys like that to make it.”"
49,2024 Free Agency Primer,"Wanted to do a quick primer on our Free Agency situation and have everything in one place before things kickoff tomorrow, since the new CBA 2nd Apron restrictions have made things kind of tricky.



**CURRENT ROSTER**

**PG:** Mike Conley | Rob Dillingham

**SG:** Ant | Nickeil Alexander Walker | PJ Dozier

**SF:** Jaden | Joe Ingles | TSJ | Minott

**PF:** KAT |  Naz Reid | Leonard Miller

**C:** Rudy | Luka Garza


**2WAY Contracts:** Jaylen Clark | Jesse Edwards (non-guaranteed) | Dashien Nix


We’ve got ~~11~~ 14 of our 15 roster spots secured, and currently are using 3 of our 3 Two Way contracts.

Due to the 2nd Apron Restrictions, we’re only able to offer Veteran’s Minimum and Minimum contracts to free agents to fill out the rest of the roster with free agents. We are allowed to go above that with re-signing our own guys however.



**OUTGOING FREE AGENTS**

**RFA:** ~~Luka Garza~~ | ~~Dashien Nix~~

**UFA:** ~~Slo-mo~~ | ~~Monte Morris~~ | ~~JMac~~


Tim Connelly has said he’d like to bring everybody back if possible, and I’m all for it considering they’d have to be replaced by guys on the veteran’s minimum, but it’ll all depend on what other teams are willing to offer, since we pay a heavy tax penalty to match or compete in terms of negotiating salaries.

Technically we can match offers on ~~Luka and~~ Nix, however with the 2nd apron restrictions, our ability to do so is heavily mitigated. Probably not a concern with Nix, ~~but Luka could draw interest from a team with cap space and a rotation spot for him like Detroit.~~



**FREE AGENCY NEEDS:**

~~Backup PG~~ (Update: We signed PJ Dozier and re-signed Nix to a 2 Way)
~~Backup C~~ (Update: We re-signed Garzilla)

We’re flush with Wings at the moment, and the only real areas of concern are forcing NAZ to be our only Big off the bench, and whether or not we want to throw Dilly right into the fire as the sole backup PG. Both Naz and Rob are completely capable of those roles, so it’s just about whether or not we want to have more flexibility with lineups and let those guys play in roles they’re more comfortable with versus have to ask them to fill very specific needs.

Obviously we could fill both of our current free agency needs by re-signing Garza and JMac, but as much as I love the continuity (and also I LOVE Luka Garza), their strengths kind of became redundant with the drafting of Dillingham and TSJ. 

We’ve got a plethora of scoring off the bench now by picking up two spark plugs in the draft. We kind of need defense-forward players in rounding out the roster to offset that, and also need more veteran presence around given how young our squad is.

I’d love pesky veteran floor general at PG to allow Rob to play some SG and just focus on scoring. I’d also love to re-sign Kyle and have him continue being a ball-handler option for the 2nd unit.



**FREE AGENCY TARGETS:**

In addition to re-signing our own guys, here’s some other dudes who I think could be good fits and *may* end up in our (heavily restricted) price range:

**Backup PG:** Pat Bev | De’Anthony Melton |  Delon Wright

**Backup C:** Daniel Theis | Javale McGee | Deandre Jordan | Thad Young

Would love Luke Kennard or Joe Ingles if they were available at our price range as well, but I doubt they will be.

Ultimately, we’re really only looking at probably one rotation guy in filling out the roster, and the rest of our signings will likely be end of bench mob guys, but I think team chemistry and bench vibes are severely underrated, so I’m hoping we can get some solid dudes despite our cap restrictions.


What do ya’ll think? Who do you want when Free Agency negotiations kicks off tomorrow.

Edit: formatting. Also, let me know if I missed anything re: 2nd apron restrictions, etc. 

2nd Edit: I stand corrected, we CAN go over the min on re-signing our guys. So that’s good news!

3rd update: We re-signed Luka!! 🤠 [Source](https://x.com/wojespn/status/1807797591599399154)

4th Update: We signed Joe Ingles and PJ Dozier and re-signed Nix to a 2 Way, so we’re at 14 out of 15 spots rostered and will most likely keep the final spot open going into the season."
50,"[Dane Moore] Jaylen Clark on playing his first two basketball games in over a year, and the process of building back after his achilles injury:","""(The first game) was like a surreal feeling. I was telling all the coaches that even though I didn’t do much, it took like three quarters to realize that I’m really out there playing. I was just out there smiling and running up and down and then I was like, 'OK bro, now you gotta do something now.' So two days ago was me just taking it all in, today I told the coaches I’m good I’m locked in and I’m ready to go. I came in here with a mission I made a bet with one of the coaches that I would get more than five steals. I felt like I had more six but we’ll leave it up to their discretion.""

""I think the thing that’s made it the hardest is that no one has seen my progress. So I go places and everybody asks me a million questions and try to assume and guess but it’s been a great year, bro. I don’t regret anything that happened – if I don’t tear my achilles, I don’t think I’m in Minnesota currently at this moment. So everything happens for a reason. I’m happy Tim Connelly and them took a chance on me and I’m very grateful to be here in Summer League. It’s a great group. Summer League group is great. Real team back at home is great. And the guys in Iowa are great. So it’s just a great overall organization."""

53,Timberwolves lose nothing of value and take a chance on a young small forward with upside. NAW trade 2.0?,"Timberwolves make a move on the margins by trading for Bucks SF MarJon Beauchamp, who has more offensive upside than Josh Minott and Wendell Moore Jr. Beauchamp hasn't been a regular rotation player for the Bucks, but he's been productive for the Wisconsin Herd in the G League averaging 22 PPG on 64% TS. 

In this trade, the Bucks get a 2nd round pick for taking salary filler. Minnesota should do this trade because their backup SF is T.J. Warren, and Tim Connelly likes taking low risk, high reward chances on young role players like Nickeil Alexander-Walker. 

Worst case scenario, Beauchamp never really develops and we lose a worthless 2029 draft pick and two guys who don't contribute. Best case scenario, Beauchamp becomes a valuable rotation player for the Timberwolves and fans look back at this as one of Tim Connelly's best moves.

Thoughts on this mock trade?"
54,Calling all cap experts: How do we keep our guys together?,"The question is simple and the answer is hard: 

*How do Tim Connelly and crew retain the key pieces of this squad, or make upgrades as needed?*

There are a few things that I believe, based on my limited understanding of the CBA:

1. We will be above the tax and the second apron for 24-25 & 25-26 if we keep all current contracts. Long story short, it makes it a lot harder to make trades and sign guys.
1. We have Bird Rights for Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Jordan McLaughlin, meaning we can choose to resign them, no matter whether or not we are over the cap.
1. Rudy Gobert & Naz Reid both have player options for 25-26. This could be an interesting time, depending on how they each are playing, but this means they could walk away from their current contract with no penalty.
1. We have player options on Minott, Brown & Milton in 24-25, and options on Moore Jr. & Minott in 25-26. This means we can cut them with no cap penalty.

This brings me to some questions and thoughts:

1. Can we extend Mike Conley for a 2-3 year deal? We have his Bird Rights, and so we can sign him being over the cap, and he is 36, so that feels like the right amount of time. My question here is this: Are there any restrictions or requirements for how much he should make?
1. Same with Mike, resign or extend Nickeil before the 25-26 season. I think keeping him should be a top priority for this front office.
1. I think picking up Brown Jr, Milton, and Minott is a good idea. Minott has potential as a player (and a trade piece, it pains me to say) and Brown and Milton could be salary filler on a trade. Alternatively, waiving Brown and Milton might get us access to the Mid-Level exception, but that is only about 5 million. Keep them or waive them?
1. Assets of Value: Josh Minott, Leonard Miller, Jaylen Clark, the rights to Matteo Spagnolo, the worse pick of Washington & Memphis' 2nd rounder, which is looking like it could land in the 32-36 range, and Utah's 2025 2nd, which could be alright as well. Who would you part with and what would you want in return?
1. The nuclear option is always available, but I truly believe it would be a mistake to trade KAT. His skillset will pull bigs out of the lane for Ant long after Rudy is done being a defensive stalwart. BUT, if you want to talk about it here, knock yourself out.
1. The real humdinger here is Rudy's player option. This could provide an interesting opportunity, depending on Gobert's health, the success of the squad, etc, but I do think it is a real possibility that Rudy would choose to decline the option and take a pay cut for the opportunity to chase a ring. He will be 33 years old. He will likely have a 4th DPOY award. He will have accomplished everything there is to on the individual level, rings will cement his legacy. This could basically be done as a sign and stretch, especially as he will be getting close to his mid-30s as a 7-footer. Maybe he would decline the 1yr/$47mil, and pick up a 4yr/$80mil, which would take him up to age 37? Would the CBA allow this?

Thanks for letting me dump my thoughts here, let me know what you think?

Edit: This hypothetical assumes that ownership will eat a tax cost. There are rules in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that limit who you can acquire and how you acquire them, depending on where you are salary-wise. The Wolves will not be able to sign a free agent, nor will they have access to Bi-Annual & Mid-Level exceptions. I don't think they can sign buyout guys. If we stay in the second apron for too long, we will be relegated the the last pick in the First round, which we may be close to anyway due to success. This post was meant as a fun point of salary cap and CBA navigation, not ""oh no, how will we avoid paying the tax."""

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1cgft9m)"
58,Trade deadline potential targets,"With the trade deadline approaching, I wanted to share my thoughts on potential players the Wolves might acquire.

**1) My favorite trade.** *Monte Morris*

https://preview.redd.it/juwozv3qxtfc1.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16fce2a6b33b88b4825e10a6763b0efddc6bb3

Morris is like a lite version of Mike Conley – a solid 3-point shooter (39% career) with an outstanding AST/TO ratio (5.4/1 last season). At 28, he brings both youth and experience, having started for an entire season in Jamal Murray's absence in 21-22 and played in 48 playoff games. With Connelly having drafted him, there's potential for a happy reunion, and Morris might consider staying after this season on a team-friendly deal (around $5-6M per year). Expecting a role of 18-20 minutes per game on a playoff-bound team can be more enticing for him than more $$. NAW/SloMo/Naz/Morris could arguably be the strongest bench among playoff teams. Also, as a fan of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" book, I really like his nickname – the ""Count of Monte Assist/TO"".

Regarding the trade, the Wolves might need to offer more $$ than just Shake and TBJ. If not, they could end up as a taxpayer team, as they'll be obligated to sign a 14th man to complete the roster. The Pistons might value WMJ, who was a 1st-round pick just a year ago, and hope for his potential development. Two reasonably decent 2nd-round picks look like a good price, with one of them likely being \~38ish this season. They also could ask for Leonard Miller, which seems like an acceptable price for a quality backup PG.

**2. Same team, different player.** *Alec Burks*

https://preview.redd.it/xjg0bczwxtfc1.jpg?width=1307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea609a0657919c79f988eaad2bb8ead6cccb6d83

Despite a slow start, Burks has averaged 17.7 points in the last 15 games on 46/48/91 shooting. He's a reliable scorer who can get to the line when needed. For a team like the Wolves that needs a dependable third scorer, Burks seems to be one of the best available options on the market. The trade may be a bit more challenging due to Burks' higher salary, and signing a buyout player for the 14th roster spot could potentially push the team into taxpayer status.

3. **A defensive guard.** *Delon Wright*

https://preview.redd.it/985k01i4ytfc1.jpg?width=1308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=481d887c9859f9247d43785f2ffb3246e7cd42d4

Delon Wright is a strong on-ball defender, but his superpower is off-ball defense, particularly in help defense and anticipating passing lanes. While not quite at an All-defense level, he has received some votes for his defense throughout his career. Wright's production is going down but he can still hit an open 3s, drive and finish with contact, and set up plays with an elite AST/TO ratio. I can envision Wright playing around 10 minutes per game in the playoffs.

4. **Bring him home!** *Tyus Jones*

https://preview.redd.it/8alqhhtgytfc1.jpg?width=1311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f3939325b10dc7f0ec21bc180e2762a4118bb3f

Tyus Jones wasn't that guy during his time with the Timberwolves. However, in Memphis, he's proven to be one of the league's best backup point guards and is currently putting up stats on a tanking Wizards team. Similar to Conley, Tyus doesn't apply much rim pressure (only 0.7 FTA per game). And just like Conley, he's sharp from 3, does not turn the ball over, and has a very efficient floater. Acquiring Tyus now could be an investment in a future point guard, although this trade might be challenging as the Wolves may want to keep Kyle Anderson. I also believe the Wizards would likely demand at least a first-round pick for him, making this deal quite challenging for the Wolves. 

5. **One more 3+D guy**. Royce O'Neil

https://preview.redd.it/5ga4cjqpytfc1.jpg?width=1297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b979ef9f0720f8b01c58ab1ed62d6499195b2f1

Adding another 3-and-D player might discourage opposing teams from playing any offense against the Wolves. O'Neil, a strong career 3-point shooting record (38%), has also demonstrated success in the playoffs (44 games, 37%). He doesn't pose much of a threat beyond shooting and does not really excel with the ball. However, if acquiring him involves giving up only Shake, TBJ, and a couple of 2nd, it could be a nice move.

6. **The best 3-point shooter this season.** Grayson Allen.

https://preview.redd.it/vef8ibn8ztfc1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d43660cf55919c88bf964d71e47fcd8b99f13952

Grayson Allen has been on fire this season, shooting an impressive 49.8% from 3 on 8.6 attempts (best in the NBA). Historically a Timberwolves killer alongside Dillion Brooks, I've personally regarded him as a better player than Beasley. I was somewhat disappointed the Wolves did not make a move to get him when the Bucks acquired him for only two 2nd-round picks. Bringing in a player like Allen could significantly boost second-unit rotations. 

In a possible trade, if Phoenix wants Miles Bridges, they'll need to offer more than Nassir Little and a couple of 2nd-round picks. In this trade idea, Phoenix loses their best shooter but gains the best player in the trade. The Wolves get a great shooter without giving up any key players, and the Hornets get a talented rookie and some 2nd-round picks. It's an interesting idea, but not very likely. 

7. **6th man for 6th man.** Bogdan Bogdanovic

https://preview.redd.it/b79ft22v0ufc1.jpg?width=1297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a89d80a2bc2e5340ad949e81262338b226bdd73

I don't think this will happen; I'm just addressing the rumors. It's hard to imagine the Wolves trading Naz, and I can't see the Hawks being interested unless Naz is involved. 

8. **A movement shooter.** Luke Kennard

https://preview.redd.it/sbvb3v0d1ufc1.jpg?width=1308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b45280e25ccec876ce391cf343a63ada543845e7

He's an excellent catch-and-shoot player, capable of winning you 1-2 playoff games by coming off screens set by Rudy. Trading SloMo and their 2nd round pick back seems like a fair value to me, benefiting both sides. Moreover, considering their depleted backcourt, perhaps Shake can find a role there and get his groove back. 

9. **A former lottery guard.** Davion Mitchell

https://preview.redd.it/x0ff2urd2ufc1.jpg?width=1299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2e7bef084f6ff3dfcf06ec12ddcea27767d7c2a

 Mitchell's minutes have decreased in his third season, and he's in and out of the rotation. A larger role on the Wolves could potentially benefit him. In my view, he's a better player than McLaughlin. 

10. **Tim Connelly's lost son.** Bones Hyland.

https://preview.redd.it/h6bnku6l2ufc1.jpg?width=1312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64e032d49068535c03670085217754c702de18a4

It's worth noting that just a year ago, many of us were considering trading Naz for Bones. Now, he seems lost in the Clippers rotation, and it's uncertain if he can contribute this season. However, he would likely get more opportunities than Moore or Minott. 

11. **A bench shot-maker.** Lonnie Walker.

https://preview.redd.it/p2x5gd7u2ufc1.jpg?width=1301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bb5660966e81cbf660c9c6933466539f264ede5

Lonnie Walker is what Shake could have been for this team. He shoots an impressive 44% from 3 on 4.9 attempts, making him a valuable asset for the second unit's offense. His strong playoff performances last year suggest he can be a key rotation player in postseason games.

64,"[Discussion] Dane, Kyle, and Dan Bowling pod on Lore/ARod group final payment and ownership outlook","Hey folks, I really recommend you check out Dane Moore's latest episode-- they did a great job on the basketball stuff as always, but the last hour is focused on the ownership situation. They have Dan Bowling on, who has become their ""Marc Lore correspondent""-- he is a local business owner/CEO who knows Lore very well (and is the CEO of the Genesis Company which sponsors the pod). 

He does an amazing job helping unpack some of the things about the ownership situation that I have not seen any other media source cover at this level of detail with this level of nuance. I summarized some of the key points below but I really recommend checking out the pod, as it's both entertaining and really interesting and informative. [Link to timestamp](https://youtu.be/udsAA74i1mw?t=2272)

- The Glen Taylor group agreed to sell the team at a price of $1.5 billion, which was universally considered an underpay/deal). **One of the terms of the purchase set by Glen Taylor was that the payment was to be acted upon in stages.** 
- AKA, the **Lore group is not buying the team ""on layaway"", but rather simply executing on the purchase under the terms set by the current owner.** ""The Lore group bought the shares available to be bought as they became available to be bought.""
- The Lore ownership group (which very publicly includes ARod, but this pod focused on Lore so I'll just say him) has **closed on 40% of the team as of today**. The next stage of the purchase is for an additional 40% of the team (for a total of 80%, majority ownership), and the Lore group has a window of December-March to make that payment.
- Dan Bowling feels that Lore is one of the great ""capital raisers"" in the world today and that his entrepreneurship track record reflects that. He believes that there should be **no concern regarding their ability to make the final payment**, and that the group has been making the payments at the end of their windows represents the fact that there's no reason to pay any earlier as the agreement has already been made. Dan **questions any ""league sources"" with reports about the Lore group's finances as no one in the NBA world has connections to Lore or knows his financial situation.** Additionally, plenty of due diligence (with accounting firms, law firms, etc. on both sides) would have happened leading up to the purchase.
- It has been reported by both sides that there was no negotiation about the price or the terms. Glen had ""tried to sell it for years"" but backed out of multiple early stage explorations. Glen found a buyer he liked and requested it be sold to them at this price in stages. **(e.g., if you come to the table and someone offers you a great price on something that you CAN afford, why would you negotiate?) Dan believes the group will absolutely be able to make that last payment.**
- Lore and the new ownership group have been in the building for a while now and are seeing how the organization has been run and getting to learn both what to do and what not to do. The new group is **not looking to just buy the team, kick the old guys out, hire their own folks and ""figure it out on the fly""**. Kyle states that **instead of ""joking around about the layaway plan"", the real angle is that the new group DID want to learn about the team and its operations, be involved in how the team is run gradually, start changing the culture**, etc. Influence of the new ownership group is clear in things like the Gobert trade and Tim Connelly hiring (including his financial package and the fact that the Wolves now have one of the largest front offices in the NBA). 
- The Lore group (ARod specifically) has stated they plan to privately fund a new stadium. Dane posits that the Lore group is probably **not just looking to fundraise for the last $600M / 40% payment, but rather that $600M AND $1B+ more for a new stadium which will be an asset independent of the team**. ""They will play basketball games there AND do all the other stuff"" that makes the owners money. With public funding comes public strings attached and the Lore ownership group is looking to control their own assets here and maximize return.
- On Bally: Dan is ""certain"" that ownership is embarrassed they can't distribute their product ""which is good"" to the fans ""who are willing to pay"" because of the company in between. They will be considering something that breaks the mold and are looking at situations like what the Suns are doing (distributing free over antenna) to distribute games to fans. 

What do you think about the ownership situation?"
65,Could the Wolves sweep regular season awards?,"MVP - Anthony Edwards
MIP - Naz Reid
6th man - Naz Reid
DPOY - Rudy Golbert
Coach of the year - Chris Finch
GM of the year - Tim Connelly

I guess no ROY so not a sweep.  But are each of these players/people not in the conversation for each award?

Obviously a lot of season left and would be unprecedented and unprobable, but not entirely impossible."
66,3rd Quarter Wolves,"That elite 3rd quarter wolves team we saw earlier in the year that would plummet teams come the second half is back and better!! This is the defense that gave us the 20-5 start. Beating Boston and holding the nuggets too 89 points, just more physical, smarter and mature. I’ve been of the opinion that we are witnessing a 08 Celtics 04 pistons lite defense (both NBA champions)

Once again Tim Connelly is a genius, two years after the Rudy trade and we are in the best position physically possible too take down the nuggets and their historic offense. Only time will tell but defense will always travel.

67,"Comparing the contract extensions of Jaden McDaniels (5 years, $131M with $5M in possible bonuses) and Devin Vassell (5 years, $135M with $11M in possible bonuses)","I found it helpful to see how San Antonio front-loaded the deal and Minnesota back-loaded their deal. Jaden's contract was masterfully structured to somewhat reduce 2nd apron woes.

|*Year*|*Jaden McDaniels*|*Devin Vassell*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**24-25** (Cap space = $149)|$22,586,207|$29,347,826|
|**25-26** (Cap space = $164)|$24,393,103|$27,000,000|
|**26-27**|$26,200,000|$27,000,000|
|**27-28**|$28,006,897|$24,652,174|
|**28-29**|$29,813,793|$27,000,000|

Key Takeaways:

1. Jaden's salary in year 1 and year 2 is only 15.2% and 14.9% of the salary cap. Salary cap will increase so his numbers will look even better. For reference, Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges salaries were 18.88% and 17% of the cap when they signed.
2. Wolves don't pay Jaden more than $25M until Rudy's contract expires. Smart of Connelly to back-load the deal. This at least gives a possibility of sneaking under it in 24-25.
3. Unless bonuses kick in, Wolves will pay a prime Jaden McDaniels less than $30M in 2029. The way salaries are increasing, that sounds like a bargain.
4. No player option. Wolves are guaranteed 5 years of Jaden.

How did they get Jaden to agree to this, and with no player option?? Let Tim Connelly cook...

71,Team Comparison: 2011 Mavericks v. 2023 Wolves,"It recently dawned on me that this years Wolves team has essentially the same pieces & elements that the 2011 Mavs had when they beat the Heat for a ring. This tells us that the ""Gobert Experiment"" does have a successful track record. I now see what the front office was trying to accomplish. A proven model that took down a Super Team. I think instead of trying to turn KAT into someone he's not, he's been allowed to flourish in a more natural role similar to what Dirk Nowitzki. A unicorn 7 footer that can shoot, dribble to the rim, and use height for easy put backs. All thanks to Gobert!

Gobert allows KAT to play more like Dirk & lets not forget how integral Tyson Chandler's role was to Dirk's success. Dirk & Tyson Chandler are probably the closest comp to KAT and Rudy and Dallas was able to win a ring with an arguably worse supporting cast. If KAT can keep it up, this lineup can win a ring. 2 very similar teams

2011 Dallas - 2023 Wolves

PG - Kidd - Conley - Both steady aging vets that can control the O

SG Terry - ANT - Wolves are clearly much stronger at this position

SF - Marion - McDaniels - Athletic wings that guard the opponents best player. 3 n D

PF Dirk - Kat - 2 of the best shooting 7 footers of all time that can get to the rim and rebound. Similar game and career stats

C Tyson - Rudy - Beefy 7ft Defensive stoppers. Perennial DPOY canditates. Can give you a bit of complimentary scoring in the paint. Frees up 7foot PF's to play less physical game.

Both teams are essentially made up of the same elements

PG - Old vet that controls the game

SG - Athletic scorer that can score in every way and play D

SF - Athletic 3 n D. Will guard best opposing player. Gives just enough scoring

PF - Unicorn 7 footers that can shoot and get to the rim by dribbling

C - 7 ft beastly DPOY candidates that make the unit a top tier tough D. Just enough scoring to not be a liability on O. Free's up unicorn 7ft PF's to play their unique brand of bball.

Summation: The '23 Wolves are just the '11 Mavs but younger, ANT being a major upgrade over Terry, and with a better/deeper bench. Tim Connelly's vision finally makes sense.

>Even with the ownership issues, Connelly’s preference was to stay in Minnesota. That includes the possibility of **signing another long-term deal after the ownership situation settles,** team sources said.

>**All indications are that both factions of Wolves ownership are open to paying the luxury tax to keep the team competitive.** For now, Taylor has the final call on any moves that are made or not made, an authority that will likely extend through the draft and free agency while the arbitration unfolds.

>Everyone below the principals involved in the fight has been caught in the middle of it, and now Connelly will play a major role in keeping them focused on the team so they do not let this season’s leap forward go to waste. He has already been successful on that front. **Before the season ended, senior vice president of basketball operations Matt Lloyd turned down a chance to take a higher-paying position in the Charlotte Hornets front office** to stay with the Timberwolves, team sources told The Athletic."
94,[Borman] A recap of Tim Connelly’s 2023 so far:,"- Traded D’Angelo Russell for Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and SRPs
 - Signed Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels to five-year extensions 
- Re-signed Naz Reid, NAW
- Brought in Shake Milton, Troy Brown Jr. 
- Traded up with SRPs from the D’Lo deal to select Leonard Miller in the second round 
- Drafted Jaylen Clark (consensus FRP before his achilles tear) late in second round  

Pretty remarkable work."

101,Tim Connelly is a genius?,"He built the Nuggets into a team that could win a championship, left the year before they won but his fingerprints were all over that championship.

He then went to Minnesota and made an insane trade everyone clowned at the time. I think he pretty specifically built the Timberwolves as a team that could take on Denver (obviously the series has just started, and Denver could easily take this series still, but it's clear that the Wolves can at a minimum hang with Denver). 

This is getting a lot more conspiratorial, and I don't fully believe it, but there is a small part of me that wonders if he partially made a big trade like that to inflate the trade market, forcing other teams to pay up the nose for players they perceive as better than Rudy. Like do the Suns have to give up as much for KD if not for that trade? Do they have more depth and can hang with the Wolves? Pretty far-fetched but let me try and cook a little bit :)

Then he makes the trade of Dlo for Conley, NAW and 2 second round picks?? An absolute killing imho. Dlo was basically addition by subtraction on its own, and then you put in a great veteran steadying presence like Conley, a top-tier 3 and D guy in NAW and 2 seconds? 

Other little moves here and there you could maybe quibble with but the big moves have been fantastic, especially in hindsight."

I believe that the Marc Lore/A-Rod helped build a winning culture from top to bottom with the Tim Connelly hire. The Rudy Gobert trade and the Mike Conley/NAW trade helped change the trajectory of the franchise, which in turn increased fan interest, and proved to the NBA world that Minnesota is in fact a great market that's worth investing in. 

Even if Taylor finds new owners, I think they'll keep the team in Minnesota because the fanbase is reinvigorated, and that wouldn't have happened without the groundwork done by Lore/A-Rod."

Amen."
109,"Tim Connelly: “Without Chris Finch, I wouldn’t be here.”","TC was on Mike Rand’s podcast episode today. Around the 28 minute mark, but the whole interview is well worth a listen."
110,We need to have an honest conversation about Jaden McDaniels...,"He hasn't quite developed into the player he should be, which is a consistent 12-15ppg wing who can defend. The gap in production between Jaden and guys like OG Anunoby, Josh Hart, Herb Jones, and Lu Dort is notable.

He's a pesky defender, but my god Jaden's offensive game is not where it needs to be for a guy making the amount of money he's making. If the Wolves want to go from good to great, he needs to be a factor on offense or Tim Connelly should consider trading him."
111,I hope we keep KAT,"I know this is a pretty low effort post, but I think he's better than Julius Randle and Lauri Markannen. KAT might not be the best fit for a defensively focused team, but it would be cool if he played his whole career with the Timberwolves unlike Garnett and Love. KAT might be the best 3pt shooting big in the history of the league. It's pretty rare nowadays for a player to retire with the team that drafted him without ever leaving, but I think that would be great if KAT got the chance to do that. Nevertheless, I'll try to trust that Connelly knows what he's doing."
112,"[Statline] Such a slept on acquisition, the king of AST/TOV ratio",This trade has been amazing. Love the energy Monte brings as well as his basketball IQ.
113,Ownership tells you they will not pay the luxury tax and you have to get below the 2nd apron—what’s your move?,"Before I even begin to dive into this post, I just want to say I’m so thankful for the wolves and the excitement they brought this year. I’m with Tim Connelly 100% that my top choice is to run it back. But TC also said ownership has the final say and he will make moves accordingly if he is told to do so. So my question is, for all of my fellow salary cap nerds, what would you do if you were TC and you were told to get below the 2nd apron to avoid the luxury tax? 

The elephant in the room here is clearly KAT. His new supermax kicking in is what puts us over the edge. So my thought is, unfortunately, if we need to reduce salary then he is the first place to start. I don’t want to give up cheaper pieces like Jaden and Naz because they match Ant’s timeline. I also don’t think you get a return for Rudy that makes a ton of sense for us given his cap hit and age. 

My suggestion: explore a trade that essentially swaps KAT for Trae Young or another young, dynamic scoring point guard that matches Ant’s timeline. Trae young will be slightly cheaper than towns moving forward, and this would push us toward our cap goal.

The hawks have made it clear they will trade Young for the right price. They have the #1 pick, and even in a weak draft, this could be their best shot to hit the reset button and build a contender from scratch. If you rope in a third team that wants KAT and will send picks to Atlanta (likely a rising team with draft capital in a similar position to where we were with gobert 2 summers ago), then a three-team deal would make a lot of sense. 

I think KAT is better than Trae today, so maybe you get back a good young role player or a decent pick too. But I’d like to hear any other pivot options. A starting lineup of Trae, Ant, Jaden, Naz, and Gobert wouldn’t be half bad, and Dallas proved you can make it to the finals with two elite guards (assuming Ant continues to develop into a top guy like Luka). "
114,Glen Taylor Mouthpiece ,"Wolfson is essentially just speaking for Glen Taylor anymore. Said Taylor is better for Wolves fans short term. Also wondered if Tim Connelly is getting too much credit.

115,"24-25 Wolves, What Improvements Do you Want To See?","I wrote this off the top of my head.. so sorry in advance for anything stupid. What are some specific improvements you'd like to see from any of the wolves players next season?

Rudy Gobert	
- this might be a case of teaching an old dog new tricks, but it would be awesome if he would get softer hands. He's been working in that Euro step, so we know he's still working on his Offense. Maybe more one dribble quick offensive moves/pivot post moves?

Karl-Anthony Towns
- I'm not sure if we'll see much many different opinions here. Keeping a steady mentality and not picking up stupid fouls. This always seems to snow ball. He'll feel that he's been slighted or treated unfairly and immediately does something silly and picks up a foul or turns it over. Beyond that, some athleticism in his drives and playing better team defense. He goes full speed head down on drives way too often. He can get by the first defender but ends up in bad situations after that. Euro, jump stop to two step, pro hop, jump stop step back 10 footer. Low post moves?

Josh Minott	
- consistent jump shot and adding some lbs 

Naz Reid	
- offensive consistency. It seems like we.knowmright away whether or not it'll be a nice Naz night or a slower night. His offense always seems to bleed into his defense where he might get into foul trouble/TOs if his shot isn't going.

Anthony Edwards
- playmaking, fitness, offball offense and defense. Limit turnovers and get that apg closer to 7 would be amazing. Coach Finch mentioned focus at home being a bit lacking. This wasn't directly attributed to Edwards, but it was after a night when he had a slower game. 

Leonard Miller	
- defense, strength, finding a way into the rotation.

Nickeil Alexander-Walker
- obviously his shot lately hasn't been falling, but we know he can regularly knock them down. He spends a lot of energy on defense, so it's understandable why his non catch and shoot offense is a little lesser. There were a lot of times where I thought he could have made a move to the rack instead of settling for a close out 3. Other times he did make a move to the rim and was blocked badly. Handles. Consistent bench scoring is a huge need (possibly partially addressed with Dillingham, but we don't know)

Jaden McDaniels	
- in the words of Anthony Edwards, if Jaden is scoring, the wolves are winning. Similar to NAW, handles, finishing strength, consistent 3pt shooting. If he can develop his own ~~shit~~ shot creation like he had at Washington, watch out. 

But definitely need to watch out for unexpected shit creation too. Haha, damnit.

Mike Conley	
- not sure what else we can possibly ask of this guy. 

Joe Ingles
- we know he has great playmaking, nice shot, familiarity with Conley and Rudy, decent size, but he's getting older so guarding might get tough. 

Luka Garza	
- quicker feet and decision making, pivot post moves, lower body strength to give another defender for the wolves to throw at dominant centers might help him get on the court.

Rob Dillingham	
- I think the hope is that we get good to great bench scoring and playmaking year one. 

Terrence Shannon Jr.	
- I think the hope is that we get defense, athletic slashing and finishing, maybe some shot creation and consistent catch and shoot 3pt jump shooting.

Jesse Edwards 
- two way, not sure we can expect much

Daishen Nix
- two way, I think Daishen could be interesting if he can figure out defense and how to use his weight/strength. I think he's closer to 6'5 than 6'3 and doesn't have great length. It would be amazing if he can take a step and find out how to guard stonger perimeter players that destroy the Timberwolves.. Zion, Luka. NAW and McDaniels tend to get tossed aside or easily screened off without being able to recover. Wolves need a strong bulldog type defender who isn't Edwards. Beyond that keep the team hyped and come up with more demoralizing bench celies.

PJ Dozier
- not sure we can expect much from PJ. This will likely be one of his last chances. PJ did end up with some starts with Denver when Mal Murray was hurt a few years ago. He did ok with those minutes. Timberwolves/any team can always use more combo guards. Tim Connelly should know PJ well. He just hasn't quite bounced back after getting hurt a few years ago. 

Jaylen Clark
- two way, assuming the wolves would like to just see him play a bit. We saw one nice summer league defensive game from hima and I think there's a lot of hope around him that he can take the step to be a regular rotation player. Maybe a Josh Okogie type dude who can knock down open looks and absolutely clamp dudes."
116,Paying the 2nd apron for 1-2 years is not the end of the world. ,"Some of my friends were fretting over the 2nd apron and said the Wolves are ""borderline crippling their future"" because of it. Investing in a championship contender (or a team who can make deep runs at the least) is huge for Ant's development and will make him a better player in the future. Is it just me, or are people really making it seem like the end of the world? It's not. Yes, I say this even with them possibly repeating in the 2nd year.

In broad terms, 2nd apron means you can't use the MLE, combine salaries in trades, and it freezes their draft pick 7 years out if they want to make a trade. But if a FO is locked into the roster and want to improve through internal development and continuity, they aren't looking to make big trades and sign FAs with the MLE anyway. Whether that is a good idea is to be seen.

If they're in the 2nd apron *for 3 years,* then it also moves that draft pick 7 years out to #30. I think they'll avoid the 3 year repeat since Conley's 2 year contract ends and they can sign Rudy to a longer, cheaper deal or let him go.

Once they are out of the 2nd apron (say after 1-2 years or in 2026), the MLE and trade penalties don't hold anymore -  can go back to combining salaries or using cash in a trade and can use the MLE again. I really think people are making it out to be the end of the world when it's not (esp if it's just for 1-2 years). Plus, Wolves FO just brought in Michael Bloomberg, the 13th richest person in the world and **the ownership groups** [**said on record that they are committed to paying the tax for 24-25** ***and beyond*** **if Tim Connelly recommends that.**](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/big_investor_to_join_wolves_ownership_group_led_by_marc_lore_alex_rodriguez/s1_14822_40451288)

Almost all championship contending teams pay the 2nd apron, this is not unique to the Wolves. My motto has been to sit back, watch the fun basketball and let the GMs do their job. If a year from now, Tim Connelly believes paying the 2nd apron for another year is a good idea and the owners said they are committed to do so, then great! What's the problem? Just enjoy the fun basketball, it's been a long time coming for us."

120,Wolves rookie Jaylen Clark (who ruptured his Achilles in March ‘23) posts video of himself in full speed 5 on 5 scrimmage,"Pretty much no chance (or need) for him to be ready to play games this year, but exciting to think the Timberwolves will be adding a former Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and finalist for the Naismith Men's Defensive Player of the Year to this already stacked defense. 

Clark was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 13 points, six rebounds, 2.6 steals and 1.9 assists in 30 games as a junior. He finished sixth in the country in steals per game, second in defensive box plus-minus (plus-6.7) and 12th in defensive win shares (2.7).

Tim Connelly: “We’re super excited about Jaylen Clark. We had him as a high first-round grade all year. Unfortunately, he had the injury. We think there is no better wing defender in the draft. I think he brings an aggression, toughness and intelligence that allows guys like that to make it.”"
121,2024 Free Agency Primer,"Wanted to do a quick primer on our Free Agency situation and have everything in one place before things kickoff tomorrow, since the new CBA 2nd Apron restrictions have made things kind of tricky.



**CURRENT ROSTER**

**PG:** Mike Conley | Rob Dillingham

**SG:** Ant | Nickeil Alexander Walker | PJ Dozier

**SF:** Jaden | Joe Ingles | TSJ | Minott

**PF:** KAT |  Naz Reid | Leonard Miller

**C:** Rudy | Luka Garza


**2WAY Contracts:** Jaylen Clark | Jesse Edwards (non-guaranteed) | Dashien Nix


We’ve got ~~11~~ 14 of our 15 roster spots secured, and currently are using 3 of our 3 Two Way contracts.

Due to the 2nd Apron Restrictions, we’re only able to offer Veteran’s Minimum and Minimum contracts to free agents to fill out the rest of the roster with free agents. We are allowed to go above that with re-signing our own guys however.



**OUTGOING FREE AGENTS**

**RFA:** ~~Luka Garza~~ | ~~Dashien Nix~~

**UFA:** ~~Slo-mo~~ | ~~Monte Morris~~ | ~~JMac~~


Tim Connelly has said he’d like to bring everybody back if possible, and I’m all for it considering they’d have to be replaced by guys on the veteran’s minimum, but it’ll all depend on what other teams are willing to offer, since we pay a heavy tax penalty to match or compete in terms of negotiating salaries.

Technically we can match offers on ~~Luka and~~ Nix, however with the 2nd apron restrictions, our ability to do so is heavily mitigated. Probably not a concern with Nix, ~~but Luka could draw interest from a team with cap space and a rotation spot for him like Detroit.~~



**FREE AGENCY NEEDS:**

~~Backup PG~~ (Update: We signed PJ Dozier and re-signed Nix to a 2 Way)
~~Backup C~~ (Update: We re-signed Garzilla)

We’re flush with Wings at the moment, and the only real areas of concern are forcing NAZ to be our only Big off the bench, and whether or not we want to throw Dilly right into the fire as the sole backup PG. Both Naz and Rob are completely capable of those roles, so it’s just about whether or not we want to have more flexibility with lineups and let those guys play in roles they’re more comfortable with versus have to ask them to fill very specific needs.

Obviously we could fill both of our current free agency needs by re-signing Garza and JMac, but as much as I love the continuity (and also I LOVE Luka Garza), their strengths kind of became redundant with the drafting of Dillingham and TSJ. 

We’ve got a plethora of scoring off the bench now by picking up two spark plugs in the draft. We kind of need defense-forward players in rounding out the roster to offset that, and also need more veteran presence around given how young our squad is.

I’d love pesky veteran floor general at PG to allow Rob to play some SG and just focus on scoring. I’d also love to re-sign Kyle and have him continue being a ball-handler option for the 2nd unit.



**FREE AGENCY TARGETS:**

In addition to re-signing our own guys, here’s some other dudes who I think could be good fits and *may* end up in our (heavily restricted) price range:

**Backup PG:** Pat Bev | De’Anthony Melton |  Delon Wright

**Backup C:** Daniel Theis | Javale McGee | Deandre Jordan | Thad Young

Would love Luke Kennard or Joe Ingles if they were available at our price range as well, but I doubt they will be.

Ultimately, we’re really only looking at probably one rotation guy in filling out the roster, and the rest of our signings will likely be end of bench mob guys, but I think team chemistry and bench vibes are severely underrated, so I’m hoping we can get some solid dudes despite our cap restrictions.


What do ya’ll think? Who do you want when Free Agency negotiations kicks off tomorrow.

Edit: formatting. Also, let me know if I missed anything re: 2nd apron restrictions, etc. 

2nd Edit: I stand corrected, we CAN go over the min on re-signing our guys. So that’s good news!

3rd update: We re-signed Luka!! 🤠 [Source](https://x.com/wojespn/status/1807797591599399154)

4th Update: We signed Joe Ingles and PJ Dozier and re-signed Nix to a 2 Way, so we’re at 14 out of 15 spots rostered and will most likely keep the final spot open going into the season."

125,Timberwolves lose nothing of value and take a chance on a young small forward with upside. NAW trade 2.0?,"Timberwolves make a move on the margins by trading for Bucks SF MarJon Beauchamp, who has more offensive upside than Josh Minott and Wendell Moore Jr. Beauchamp hasn't been a regular rotation player for the Bucks, but he's been productive for the Wisconsin Herd in the G League averaging 22 PPG on 64% TS. 

In this trade, the Bucks get a 2nd round pick for taking salary filler. Minnesota should do this trade because their backup SF is T.J. Warren, and Tim Connelly likes taking low risk, high reward chances on young role players like Nickeil Alexander-Walker. 

Worst case scenario, Beauchamp never really develops and we lose a worthless 2029 draft pick and two guys who don't contribute. Best case scenario, Beauchamp becomes a valuable rotation player for the Timberwolves and fans look back at this as one of Tim Connelly's best moves.

Thoughts on this mock trade?"
126,Calling all cap experts: How do we keep our guys together?,"The question is simple and the answer is hard: 

*How do Tim Connelly and crew retain the key pieces of this squad, or make upgrades as needed?*

There are a few things that I believe, based on my limited understanding of the CBA:

1. We will be above the tax and the second apron for 24-25 & 25-26 if we keep all current contracts. Long story short, it makes it a lot harder to make trades and sign guys.
1. We have Bird Rights for Mike Conley, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Jordan McLaughlin, meaning we can choose to resign them, no matter whether or not we are over the cap.
1. Rudy Gobert & Naz Reid both have player options for 25-26. This could be an interesting time, depending on how they each are playing, but this means they could walk away from their current contract with no penalty.
1. We have player options on Minott, Brown & Milton in 24-25, and options on Moore Jr. & Minott in 25-26. This means we can cut them with no cap penalty.

This brings me to some questions and thoughts:

1. Can we extend Mike Conley for a 2-3 year deal? We have his Bird Rights, and so we can sign him being over the cap, and he is 36, so that feels like the right amount of time. My question here is this: Are there any restrictions or requirements for how much he should make?
1. Same with Mike, resign or extend Nickeil before the 25-26 season. I think keeping him should be a top priority for this front office.
1. I think picking up Brown Jr, Milton, and Minott is a good idea. Minott has potential as a player (and a trade piece, it pains me to say) and Brown and Milton could be salary filler on a trade. Alternatively, waiving Brown and Milton might get us access to the Mid-Level exception, but that is only about 5 million. Keep them or waive them?
1. Assets of Value: Josh Minott, Leonard Miller, Jaylen Clark, the rights to Matteo Spagnolo, the worse pick of Washington & Memphis' 2nd rounder, which is looking like it could land in the 32-36 range, and Utah's 2025 2nd, which could be alright as well. Who would you part with and what would you want in return?
1. The nuclear option is always available, but I truly believe it would be a mistake to trade KAT. His skillset will pull bigs out of the lane for Ant long after Rudy is done being a defensive stalwart. BUT, if you want to talk about it here, knock yourself out.
1. The real humdinger here is Rudy's player option. This could provide an interesting opportunity, depending on Gobert's health, the success of the squad, etc, but I do think it is a real possibility that Rudy would choose to decline the option and take a pay cut for the opportunity to chase a ring. He will be 33 years old. He will likely have a 4th DPOY award. He will have accomplished everything there is to on the individual level, rings will cement his legacy. This could basically be done as a sign and stretch, especially as he will be getting close to his mid-30s as a 7-footer. Maybe he would decline the 1yr/$47mil, and pick up a 4yr/$80mil, which would take him up to age 37? Would the CBA allow this?

Thanks for letting me dump my thoughts here, let me know what you think?

Edit: This hypothetical assumes that ownership will eat a tax cost. There are rules in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that limit who you can acquire and how you acquire them, depending on where you are salary-wise. The Wolves will not be able to sign a free agent, nor will they have access to Bi-Annual & Mid-Level exceptions. I don't think they can sign buyout guys. If we stay in the second apron for too long, we will be relegated the the last pick in the First round, which we may be close to anyway due to success. This post was meant as a fun point of salary cap and CBA navigation, not ""oh no, how will we avoid paying the tax."""

130,Trade deadline potential targets,"With the trade deadline approaching, I wanted to share my thoughts on potential players the Wolves might acquire.

**1) My favorite trade.** *Monte Morris*

https://preview.redd.it/juwozv3qxtfc1.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16fce2a6b33b88b4825e10a6763b0efddc6bb3

Morris is like a lite version of Mike Conley – a solid 3-point shooter (39% career) with an outstanding AST/TO ratio (5.4/1 last season). At 28, he brings both youth and experience, having started for an entire season in Jamal Murray's absence in 21-22 and played in 48 playoff games. With Connelly having drafted him, there's potential for a happy reunion, and Morris might consider staying after this season on a team-friendly deal (around $5-6M per year). Expecting a role of 18-20 minutes per game on a playoff-bound team can be more enticing for him than more $$. NAW/SloMo/Naz/Morris could arguably be the strongest bench among playoff teams. Also, as a fan of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" book, I really like his nickname – the ""Count of Monte Assist/TO"".

Regarding the trade, the Wolves might need to offer more $$ than just Shake and TBJ. If not, they could end up as a taxpayer team, as they'll be obligated to sign a 14th man to complete the roster. The Pistons might value WMJ, who was a 1st-round pick just a year ago, and hope for his potential development. Two reasonably decent 2nd-round picks look like a good price, with one of them likely being \~38ish this season. They also could ask for Leonard Miller, which seems like an acceptable price for a quality backup PG.

**2. Same team, different player.** *Alec Burks*

https://preview.redd.it/xjg0bczwxtfc1.jpg?width=1307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea609a0657919c79f988eaad2bb8ead6cccb6d83

Despite a slow start, Burks has averaged 17.7 points in the last 15 games on 46/48/91 shooting. He's a reliable scorer who can get to the line when needed. For a team like the Wolves that needs a dependable third scorer, Burks seems to be one of the best available options on the market. The trade may be a bit more challenging due to Burks' higher salary, and signing a buyout player for the 14th roster spot could potentially push the team into taxpayer status.

3. **A defensive guard.** *Delon Wright*

https://preview.redd.it/985k01i4ytfc1.jpg?width=1308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=481d887c9859f9247d43785f2ffb3246e7cd42d4

Delon Wright is a strong on-ball defender, but his superpower is off-ball defense, particularly in help defense and anticipating passing lanes. While not quite at an All-defense level, he has received some votes for his defense throughout his career. Wright's production is going down but he can still hit an open 3s, drive and finish with contact, and set up plays with an elite AST/TO ratio. I can envision Wright playing around 10 minutes per game in the playoffs.

4. **Bring him home!** *Tyus Jones*

https://preview.redd.it/8alqhhtgytfc1.jpg?width=1311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f3939325b10dc7f0ec21bc180e2762a4118bb3f

Tyus Jones wasn't that guy during his time with the Timberwolves. However, in Memphis, he's proven to be one of the league's best backup point guards and is currently putting up stats on a tanking Wizards team. Similar to Conley, Tyus doesn't apply much rim pressure (only 0.7 FTA per game). And just like Conley, he's sharp from 3, does not turn the ball over, and has a very efficient floater. Acquiring Tyus now could be an investment in a future point guard, although this trade might be challenging as the Wolves may want to keep Kyle Anderson. I also believe the Wizards would likely demand at least a first-round pick for him, making this deal quite challenging for the Wolves. 

5. **One more 3+D guy**. Royce O'Neil

https://preview.redd.it/5ga4cjqpytfc1.jpg?width=1297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b979ef9f0720f8b01c58ab1ed62d6499195b2f1

Adding another 3-and-D player might discourage opposing teams from playing any offense against the Wolves. O'Neil, a strong career 3-point shooting record (38%), has also demonstrated success in the playoffs (44 games, 37%). He doesn't pose much of a threat beyond shooting and does not really excel with the ball. However, if acquiring him involves giving up only Shake, TBJ, and a couple of 2nd, it could be a nice move.

6. **The best 3-point shooter this season.** Grayson Allen.

https://preview.redd.it/vef8ibn8ztfc1.jpg?width=1325&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d43660cf55919c88bf964d71e47fcd8b99f13952

Grayson Allen has been on fire this season, shooting an impressive 49.8% from 3 on 8.6 attempts (best in the NBA). Historically a Timberwolves killer alongside Dillion Brooks, I've personally regarded him as a better player than Beasley. I was somewhat disappointed the Wolves did not make a move to get him when the Bucks acquired him for only two 2nd-round picks. Bringing in a player like Allen could significantly boost second-unit rotations. 

In a possible trade, if Phoenix wants Miles Bridges, they'll need to offer more than Nassir Little and a couple of 2nd-round picks. In this trade idea, Phoenix loses their best shooter but gains the best player in the trade. The Wolves get a great shooter without giving up any key players, and the Hornets get a talented rookie and some 2nd-round picks. It's an interesting idea, but not very likely. 

7. **6th man for 6th man.** Bogdan Bogdanovic

https://preview.redd.it/b79ft22v0ufc1.jpg?width=1297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a89d80a2bc2e5340ad949e81262338b226bdd73

I don't think this will happen; I'm just addressing the rumors. It's hard to imagine the Wolves trading Naz, and I can't see the Hawks being interested unless Naz is involved. 

8. **A movement shooter.** Luke Kennard

https://preview.redd.it/sbvb3v0d1ufc1.jpg?width=1308&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b45280e25ccec876ce391cf343a63ada543845e7

He's an excellent catch-and-shoot player, capable of winning you 1-2 playoff games by coming off screens set by Rudy. Trading SloMo and their 2nd round pick back seems like a fair value to me, benefiting both sides. Moreover, considering their depleted backcourt, perhaps Shake can find a role there and get his groove back. 

9. **A former lottery guard.** Davion Mitchell

https://preview.redd.it/x0ff2urd2ufc1.jpg?width=1299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2e7bef084f6ff3dfcf06ec12ddcea27767d7c2a

 Mitchell's minutes have decreased in his third season, and he's in and out of the rotation. A larger role on the Wolves could potentially benefit him. In my view, he's a better player than McLaughlin. 

10. **Tim Connelly's lost son.** Bones Hyland.

https://preview.redd.it/h6bnku6l2ufc1.jpg?width=1312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64e032d49068535c03670085217754c702de18a4

It's worth noting that just a year ago, many of us were considering trading Naz for Bones. Now, he seems lost in the Clippers rotation, and it's uncertain if he can contribute this season. However, he would likely get more opportunities than Moore or Minott. 

11. **A bench shot-maker.** Lonnie Walker.

https://preview.redd.it/p2x5gd7u2ufc1.jpg?width=1301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bb5660966e81cbf660c9c6933466539f264ede5

Lonnie Walker is what Shake could have been for this team. He shoots an impressive 44% from 3 on 4.9 attempts, making him a valuable asset for the second unit's offense. His strong playoff performances last year suggest he can be a key rotation player in postseason games.

133,What is to blame for the inconsistent offense the Wolves have?,"Honestly I don’t even know how it could be fixed. Because on one had they could definitely receive better plays, and scouting on how to attack defenses. But it could also be that the players need to take better initiative on when to pass, and when to attack with and without the ball too

134,Consequences of a deep playoff run,"My initial reaction to the KAT injury was “well there goes our playoff chances”. But the way they’ve looked in the last four games has me thinking that there’s at least a chance for a deep push. 

Which brought me to this question….. 

If the Wolves make a deep playoff run with KAT not being involved, let’s say WCF and the series ends in a competitive game 7, given the impending cap situation, would that be enough for Tim Connelly to trade Towns in the offseason? "
135,Playoff Predictions?,"Coming off a pretty strong road stretch and knowing that the Wolves can still make a move in the buyout market, things are looking better than ever around here.. Where do you think the Wolves will finish in the playoffs? Drop your spicy predictions (example: Lost to Spurs in WCF 4-3)  in the comments and we can look back at them in June.  


My (very biased) prediction at the start of this year was BOS over MIN 4-2 in the Finals and I'm sticking to it.

136,"[Discussion] Dane, Kyle, and Dan Bowling pod on Lore/ARod group final payment and ownership outlook","Hey folks, I really recommend you check out Dane Moore's latest episode-- they did a great job on the basketball stuff as always, but the last hour is focused on the ownership situation. They have Dan Bowling on, who has become their ""Marc Lore correspondent""-- he is a local business owner/CEO who knows Lore very well (and is the CEO of the Genesis Company which sponsors the pod). 

He does an amazing job helping unpack some of the things about the ownership situation that I have not seen any other media source cover at this level of detail with this level of nuance. I summarized some of the key points below but I really recommend checking out the pod, as it's both entertaining and really interesting and informative. [Link to timestamp](https://youtu.be/udsAA74i1mw?t=2272)

- The Glen Taylor group agreed to sell the team at a price of $1.5 billion, which was universally considered an underpay/deal). **One of the terms of the purchase set by Glen Taylor was that the payment was to be acted upon in stages.** 
- AKA, the **Lore group is not buying the team ""on layaway"", but rather simply executing on the purchase under the terms set by the current owner.** ""The Lore group bought the shares available to be bought as they became available to be bought.""
- The Lore ownership group (which very publicly includes ARod, but this pod focused on Lore so I'll just say him) has **closed on 40% of the team as of today**. The next stage of the purchase is for an additional 40% of the team (for a total of 80%, majority ownership), and the Lore group has a window of December-March to make that payment.
- Dan Bowling feels that Lore is one of the great ""capital raisers"" in the world today and that his entrepreneurship track record reflects that. He believes that there should be **no concern regarding their ability to make the final payment**, and that the group has been making the payments at the end of their windows represents the fact that there's no reason to pay any earlier as the agreement has already been made. Dan **questions any ""league sources"" with reports about the Lore group's finances as no one in the NBA world has connections to Lore or knows his financial situation.** Additionally, plenty of due diligence (with accounting firms, law firms, etc. on both sides) would have happened leading up to the purchase.
- It has been reported by both sides that there was no negotiation about the price or the terms. Glen had ""tried to sell it for years"" but backed out of multiple early stage explorations. Glen found a buyer he liked and requested it be sold to them at this price in stages. **(e.g., if you come to the table and someone offers you a great price on something that you CAN afford, why would you negotiate?) Dan believes the group will absolutely be able to make that last payment.**
- Lore and the new ownership group have been in the building for a while now and are seeing how the organization has been run and getting to learn both what to do and what not to do. The new group is **not looking to just buy the team, kick the old guys out, hire their own folks and ""figure it out on the fly""**. Kyle states that **instead of ""joking around about the layaway plan"", the real angle is that the new group DID want to learn about the team and its operations, be involved in how the team is run gradually, start changing the culture**, etc. Influence of the new ownership group is clear in things like the Gobert trade and Tim Connelly hiring (including his financial package and the fact that the Wolves now have one of the largest front offices in the NBA). 
- The Lore group (ARod specifically) has stated they plan to privately fund a new stadium. Dane posits that the Lore group is probably **not just looking to fundraise for the last $600M / 40% payment, but rather that $600M AND $1B+ more for a new stadium which will be an asset independent of the team**. ""They will play basketball games there AND do all the other stuff"" that makes the owners money. With public funding comes public strings attached and the Lore ownership group is looking to control their own assets here and maximize return.
- On Bally: Dan is ""certain"" that ownership is embarrassed they can't distribute their product ""which is good"" to the fans ""who are willing to pay"" because of the company in between. They will be considering something that breaks the mold and are looking at situations like what the Suns are doing (distributing free over antenna) to distribute games to fans. 

What do you think about the ownership situation?"
137,Could the Wolves sweep regular season awards?,"MVP - Anthony Edwards
MIP - Naz Reid
6th man - Naz Reid
DPOY - Rudy Golbert
Coach of the year - Chris Finch
GM of the year - Tim Connelly

I guess no ROY so not a sweep.  But are each of these players/people not in the conversation for each award?

Obviously a lot of season left and would be unprecedented and unprobable, but not entirely impossible."
138,3rd Quarter Wolves,"That elite 3rd quarter wolves team we saw earlier in the year that would plummet teams come the second half is back and better!! This is the defense that gave us the 20-5 start. Beating Boston and holding the nuggets too 89 points, just more physical, smarter and mature. I’ve been of the opinion that we are witnessing a 08 Celtics 04 pistons lite defense (both NBA champions)

Once again Tim Connelly is a genius, two years after the Rudy trade and we are in the best position physically possible too take down the nuggets and their historic offense. Only time will tell but defense will always travel.

Timberwolves in their first two play off games 

ORTG: 121.5
DRTG: 91.5
NRTG: +30

And zero signs of slowing down 
"
139,"Comparing the contract extensions of Jaden McDaniels (5 years, $131M with $5M in possible bonuses) and Devin Vassell (5 years, $135M with $11M in possible bonuses)","I found it helpful to see how San Antonio front-loaded the deal and Minnesota back-loaded their deal. Jaden's contract was masterfully structured to somewhat reduce 2nd apron woes.

|*Year*|*Jaden McDaniels*|*Devin Vassell*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**24-25** (Cap space = $149)|$22,586,207|$29,347,826|
|**25-26** (Cap space = $164)|$24,393,103|$27,000,000|
|**26-27**|$26,200,000|$27,000,000|
|**27-28**|$28,006,897|$24,652,174|
|**28-29**|$29,813,793|$27,000,000|

Key Takeaways:

1. Jaden's salary in year 1 and year 2 is only 15.2% and 14.9% of the salary cap. Salary cap will increase so his numbers will look even better. For reference, Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges salaries were 18.88% and 17% of the cap when they signed.
2. Wolves don't pay Jaden more than $25M until Rudy's contract expires. Smart of Connelly to back-load the deal. This at least gives a possibility of sneaking under it in 24-25.
3. Unless bonuses kick in, Wolves will pay a prime Jaden McDaniels less than $30M in 2029. The way salaries are increasing, that sounds like a bargain.
4. No player option. Wolves are guaranteed 5 years of Jaden.

How did they get Jaden to agree to this, and with no player option?? Let Tim Connelly cook...

140,Sorry Tim,
141,Timberwolves recall forwards Leonard Miller and Josh Minott and guard Wendell Moore Jr. from G League affiliate @iawolves.,
142,The “Small Ball is the New NBA” cultists watching the 3 Towers dominate the floor tonight,Tim Connelly and Chris Finch zagged when everyone else zigged. Tough. 😤
143,Team Comparison: 2011 Mavericks v. 2023 Wolves,"It recently dawned on me that this years Wolves team has essentially the same pieces & elements that the 2011 Mavs had when they beat the Heat for a ring. This tells us that the ""Gobert Experiment"" does have a successful track record. I now see what the front office was trying to accomplish. A proven model that took down a Super Team. I think instead of trying to turn KAT into someone he's not, he's been allowed to flourish in a more natural role similar to what Dirk Nowitzki. A unicorn 7 footer that can shoot, dribble to the rim, and use height for easy put backs. All thanks to Gobert!

Gobert allows KAT to play more like Dirk & lets not forget how integral Tyson Chandler's role was to Dirk's success. Dirk & Tyson Chandler are probably the closest comp to KAT and Rudy and Dallas was able to win a ring with an arguably worse supporting cast. If KAT can keep it up, this lineup can win a ring. 2 very similar teams

2011 Dallas - 2023 Wolves

PG - Kidd - Conley - Both steady aging vets that can control the O

SG Terry - ANT - Wolves are clearly much stronger at this position

SF - Marion - McDaniels - Athletic wings that guard the opponents best player. 3 n D

PF Dirk - Kat - 2 of the best shooting 7 footers of all time that can get to the rim and rebound. Similar game and career stats

C Tyson - Rudy - Beefy 7ft Defensive stoppers. Perennial DPOY canditates. Can give you a bit of complimentary scoring in the paint. Frees up 7foot PF's to play less physical game.

Both teams are essentially made up of the same elements

PG - Old vet that controls the game

SG - Athletic scorer that can score in every way and play D

SF - Athletic 3 n D. Will guard best opposing player. Gives just enough scoring

PF - Unicorn 7 footers that can shoot and get to the rim by dribbling

C - 7 ft beastly DPOY candidates that make the unit a top tier tough D. Just enough scoring to not be a liability on O. Free's up unicorn 7ft PF's to play their unique brand of bball.

Summation: The '23 Wolves are just the '11 Mavs but younger, ANT being a major upgrade over Terry, and with a better/deeper bench. Tim Connelly's vision finally makes sense. He knew what he was doing the entire time. DLo for Conley trade just as important as Gobert trade to make it a cohesive team. "
