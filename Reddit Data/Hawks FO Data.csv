0,[92.9] Atlanta Hawks Steve Koonin on meeting with Alexander Sarr,
1,Hawks CEO Steve Koonin when he went on the radio before NBA Free Agency and said that the Hawks are going to be active and the talk of the league.,
2,"[Hawks CEO Steve Koonin] “Money is not an obstacle, it’s getting it done the right way and doing it the right way that’s much more difficult than meets the eye” on the team’s lack of spending to upgrade the roster",
3,Hawks CEO Steve Koonin today on 92.9TheGame on what to expect from the franchise when free agency begins on June 30th/Said in next week to 10 days the Atlanta Hawks will be in the news quite a bit.,
4,It’s time to move on from Steve Koonin.,He has been in charge since 2014 and this organization has been hot garbage. So many terrible decisions and a lack of willingness to improve the team. He was an executive at Coke and TNT with really no background in basketball. I like him personally. He’s entertaining on 92.9 and he’s a Georgia boy but enough is enough. We can’t fire our terrible owner so getting rid of him makes sense. Our front office is trash. Our roster sucks and it’s time to clean house.
5,Membership Continues to Decline,"Just got my email for the Meet the Team event, and we have $25 PER MEMBER to spend on food and beverage. That’s $12.50 each for my buddy and me.

Look, I’m not the type of guy that would normally complain about free food. But hear me out:

1. $12.50 is literally not enough to buy a burger and fries with current prices at State Farm Arena.

2. Last year food was free, and that was honestly half the experience with how quickly they got players in and out the door. I was there since doors opened and got through ONE line, so walking around and eating a ton of food was the best part.

I know there was a thread on here a few weeks ago about renewing membership, and I commented my grievances on there as well, despite saying I’d probably renew, but… it just feels more and more like they’re trying to push us out the door. It’s such a small change in the grand scheme of things, but this might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for me.

Any other members feel this way?"
6,"So much for being in the news ""quite a bit""",
7,"The Hawks are ending the Murray-Trae Young experiment, bringing on a promising young wing in Dyson Daniels and getting a pick in the deep 2025 draft. Landry Fields knew Hawks had to make a move in backcourt and there's still more offseason work to be done.",
8,"Free agent guard Vit Krejci has agreed on a four-year, $10 million deal to return to the Atlanta Hawks, his agents Alex Saratsis and Phillip Parun of @octagonBsktball tell ESPN. At 24, Krejci has been a player development success story for Quin Snyder, Landry Fields and Hawks.",
9,I'd like to issue a formal apology to Landry Fields & Zaccharie Risacher,
10,"“Alex Sarr DECLINED to work out with the Atlanta Hawks, per GM Landry Fields on @929TheGame”","I just have a hard time understanding why the GM would come out and make a public statement like this…

Reading between the lines, this reads that Atlanta will NOT take Sarr and the disagreement between Sarr and Atlanta is very real. Doing so, that takes away any leverage you had with the pick to begin with.

Even if Sarr wasn’t the top pick on the board, it makes very little sense to me why the GM would come out and unleverage the pick like that.

Not to mention Risacher being a plus defender in his own right, we have excellent defenders coming onto this team en masse."
19,Landry Fields Zoom Media Address,"**Lauren Williams** 

Hawks GM Landry Fields is addressing the media post trade deadline and similarly to Media Day in Oct., *internal development continues to be a key focus for this team.*

Fields noted when asked about weighing the option of the team ""getting worse"" in the short term to make them better in the long term that he had *""no interest in tanking""*

I did ask him about the benchmarks they may have in place that will inform them on when to do something. *""It's the measurements, it's the things that we value. At the end of the day, some of that stuff is tangible. Some of it is intangible.""*

He talks a lot about patience and that they have to weigh the short vs. long term impact and that right now their focus is on the long term.

When asked if he could envision this team without Trae Young in future, Fields said,* ""I haven't even sat down and thought about that. I'm focused on what's in front of me.""*

I asked about the TPE (which they have a year to use) from the John Collins deal, ""it's an important tool. It's a helpful tool as we go into the summer post draft, free agency & when everything comes back into where we have these opportunities to externally change our team.""

I also asked about his philosphy on adding some size to the roster, ""it's definitely a focus of ours. It's part of our objectives for the future.""

Regarding the buyout market, he said there's nothing they're doing right now but that they'll keep they're ""keeping a pulse on that market, for sure.""

**Brad Rowland** 

But Fields just noted recent ""upticks"" from players like Johnson, Okongwu, and Bey as factors in standing pat.



**Kevin Chouinard**

Landry Fields noted upticks for Okongwu, J. Johnson and Bey as factors in staying where they are at the deadline.


Landry Fields noted that AJ Griffin's personal issues posed setbacks to his season and that he could see time in College Park soon. Also said that defense was a growth area for him.

Landry Fields on whether or not the pairing of Trae and Dejounte would work out out, and on the numbers on the sample size to date not looking great:

The sample size is getting larger and larger and larger, and assuming you're looking at specific lineups, and defensive and offensive ratings, which can always be debated as well. Yeah, you're starting to see that more and more. And, yeah, I can't lie to you. The numbers speak for themselves on that. But we're also interested in, well, let's say they're on the court together and based off the numbers, it's not working out. Why is that? What are things that we can do for them in the development aspect to make it look more like the on/off lineups that I'm assuming that you're looking at? And ultimately that then lays something out that is measurable. Those are things now that from a development standpoint that you can look at and say, 'OK, can you progress in these areas?' If f you can't, then yeah, those are times like that - I'm not saying that's exactly how's going to happen - with any player where you have to consider the changes that everyone would then be asking and looking for at the end of the day.


Landry Fields, on his confidence Trae/Dejounte pair works out:

""I think those guys are competitors. I think that at the end of the day, they want to do what they need to do to win. And I would bank on that. I'm very confident in that. If that changes, then we'll see changes.""

**Others**

When asked about if he could envision this team without Trae Young on it, Hawks GM Landry Fields said that is something that he has not thought about

Hawks GM Landry Fields to @MarkZinno & @sportsandra “patience is key”

**Hawks Fan TV**

Landry during this media conference was adamant on the fact that getting worse in the short term to help their long term plan is not something they envision. “No tanking” essentially. 

Seems like we’re stuck in purgatory. Don’t want to tank, but don’t want to fully invest in the roster to be in a position to become a contender. Just in the middle (or slightly below mid)

Updating as we go"
27,Landry Fields and the Hawks FO after the Trade Deadline ended.,
28,Audio from today’s press conference with Landry Fields,
29,Sam Vecenie’s most recent mock: Donovan Clingan to Hawks? Why No. 1 pick is still up for grabs,"Behind a pay wall so here’s the bit about the Hawks: 

1. Atlanta Hawks

Donovan Clingan | 7-2 center | 20 years old | Connecticut

The conversation around the Hawks has been fascinating to track. Despite Hawks’ general manager Landry Fields saying the team is comfortable selecting at No. 1, league sources continue to get the impression Atlanta is open to offers for the right deal.

One reason: Clingan is the name I have heard linked with the Hawks most often over this past week. He wouldn’t be the sexiest pick, but would fill a few objectives for Atlanta. Firstly, the organization has not yet shown any indication of rebuilding, so it might prefer to select a player who can fit with its roster sooner rather than later. Secondly, coach Quin Snyder had success in Utah building around an elite big man screener and rim protector in Rudy Gobert. Clingan, who impressed in a recent workout for Atlanta, would provide the Hawks a potentially dominant interior presence and high-character big locked up for the near term.

Clingan had a monster close to the season, helping lead Connecticut to a second straight national title while averaging 13.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.9 blocks over his last 18 games, including 16 points, 9.4 rebounds and three blocks in his last seven. After returning from early-season ankle and foot injuries and getting back up to speed, he was one of the most dominant players in college basketball and was arguably the most imposing defender in the country through his sheer presence.

In my last mock draft in early June, I noted Clingan has been viewed as a potential option to go in the top three, and that remains the case. The Hawks might view Clingan more as a potential trade-down target and believe Risacher is a better potential option if they keep the No. 1 pick. The team has a workout with Risacher scheduled this week, which could result in a change of course in one direction or another. This selection process doesn’t seem like a done deal at this stage.

Atlanta might not even be able to move down all that far if it wants Clingan, as several teams picking below the top 3, including Memphis and Chicago, are interested in him and might try to trade up themselves."
30,Thank you Tony Ressler,"Thank you for bringing back the bad old days of the Atlanta Spirit ownership. You had a basketball guy running the team, made it to Eastern Conf finals and building toward a bright future, but that was too good for the Atlanta fans so you gave us the genius that is Landry Fields. Nice work *chefs kiss* putting us Hawks fans in our place. The nerve of us having hope that we can maybe win a ship. This season appears to be the beginning of a precipitous fall 
And we owe it all to you and your genius GM. Much appreciated. "
31,"[Marc J. Spears] Alexandre Sarr sits down to talk French and family hoop legacy, and his hopes of being the top pick. ""Sarr believes he should be the #1 pick, he is quite familiar with life in Atlanta and the hawks after playing with OTE""",
32,We're Cooked: An Unorganized Rant (Please comment if you agree or disagree),"I just watched Landry Fields summer league press conference and WE'RE COOKED

https://preview.redd.it/l4w3kuxs0rbd1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b4b70ad71ef6ce674aff5d27a5f8bfeea7f9a1f

  
Before we play a summer league game let's go over how the summer has gone.

-We somehow won the draft lottery in one of the only years there was no clear No. 1.

-Alex Sarr's agent told our front office, he is not coming for a workout, he does not want to be the No. 1 pick because they did not trust our front office nor coaching staff to develop him, even though we have the best assist man in the league. 

-Didn't make any trades before/during draft to get draft capital back. Except Trading former No. 16 overall pick A.J. Griffin for pick No. 44, then trading up to No. 43.  

-Select the smallest Frenchman available. Risacher may be great but not for a few years at least so we are going backwards not keeping the same pace.

-Unable to offload Capella's expiring contract to give Big O more minutes. Unable to offload DeAndre's big contract to give Risacher a clearer path to playing. 

-Trade with New Orleans where we do not receive Ingram, Herb Jones, or Trey Murphy. We give up Dejounte for pennies on the dollar and lose our draft future in the process. All we did got was Larry Nance Jr. Dyson Daniels 2025 draft pick from the lakers so pick 15-20 and a 2027 pick.

- We have also not signed a single free agent above the minimum since (I had to double check to make sure this was correct) AUGUST OF 2021!!!!

-Decline to pick up Bey's restricted free agency so we can't even sign and trade for a 2nd round pick next millennium

So our starters are Trae Bogi Hunter Johnson Capella.

Huh... that seems worse than last year, then comes the lack of depth

Big O Risacher Daniels Gueye are the only ones i think have potential, maybe Kobe

Then Lundy Liddell Matthews Fernando Zeller Nance are all replaceable with anyone on the minimum.

  
It appears that's all the moves we will make before the start of the season.



I'm just ready for next years lottery when the spurs win no. 1 pick and get Cooper Flagg to go with Wemby and Castle. Every decision this organization makes is the wrong one.  

"
33,This sorry ass franchise doesn’t deserve Trae,"We don’t deserve him wasting away what’s soon to be his prime because this inept ass franchise can’t draft or sign or trade for players that can elevate this team. I’m tired of seeing him get slandered bc the organization as a whole has always been a shit show, I’m tired of seeing him not get his flowers or all star nods or whatever tf it is bc of this perception people have of him as not being a winning player when in reality he’s just stuck on this clown show of a team."
34,Its about to get oh so much worse...,"So, I am not the wisest of NBA fans... I don't know the difference between different types of defenses or understand the nuance of different offenses... I freely admit I am the most basic type of fan.  I want to watch my team 1. WIN 2. Be entertaining and 3. Be a team I am proud of.


But even as a mostly ignorant fan, I can see what I am so surprised that so many other do not seem to be seeing.  This team is about to get MUCH MUCH worse... not better.   Why would I say this?   Simple.... we are losing Trae...  in fact, barring a major change in the roster and the fortunes of this team, I would argue Trae has already decided he is gone when he is a Free Agent.


Lets take Trae's own words for what he said...

Back in April, when asked about staying or going elsewhere as the Trae or DJ rumors started Trae was quoted as saying... 


""I want to be here,"" Young said. ""I want to be here, but I want to win too.""  ""That's pretty much all it is for me,"" he added.  When asked if he believes that he can win with the Hawks, Young said that he thinks ""it can be here, we just got to make it happen.""


In early May on his Podcast, Trae stated ""I think... it means what it means. Everybody knows that I want to be in Atlanta. When I was drafted here, I said that I wanted to spend my whole career here, but at the same time, I want to win. So like, if we are not on the same page at all and wanting to win right now, there are times that teams want to be slow with winning and a process but I am not there anymore, like I want to win and I have always been that way, I feel like I don't have very much time to waste. So, I just want to continue to play at a high level and I can do that and play at a high level and win""



Unless you really cannot read between the lines, Trae basically said.... ""I am in my prime.  I want to win, and I want this team to show me that they are committed to winning and building a winner now""


So what did the Hawks do?  We traded DJ for future draft picks... 
A 2025 pick that I think is protected (might be wrong) and a 2027 pick that is also protected.   Oh yeah... and Larry Nance who is ho-hum at best, and Dyson Daniels who is good defensively but has no offensive game really.

Sure, we drafted a good kid, but few out there really expect him to come in and be an immediate superstar... most suggest he will take a few years to really become his potential best self.

And otherwise, we have the same old soft team.   Capela, OO, Hunter...  A bunch of C+ or B- players who wouldn't be a starter at their position in probably more than 1/2 of the league.

And I understand the tired arguement of Landry Fields is working out from under old/bad deals.   Guess what... that is the job... You had the #1 pick and either DJ or Trae that you could have mixed and matched in a trade to likely move down a few spots and get the exact same player we got (Risacher) while either picking up a QUALITY player in trade, or possibly an extra pick NOW or maybe even gotten another club to take Capella or Hunter off of our hands.


Landry Fields prior to becoming the Hawks GM had ONE year of any sort of front office experience, being the GM of the freaking G-League Spurs affiliate.   Then being the assistant GM for the Hawks for 2 years before taking over for Travis Schlenk.  Schlenk was essentially fired/moved because he did not agree with the DJ trade... which it now looks like he was right about?


All this to say... we have an owner that doesn't want to spend.

An owner's son who isn't qualified but has forced his way into team personnel decisions

A General Manager who is a ""yes man"" to ownership and looks to be stuck on slow or pause at making moves.

And a team full of mostly soft players who all look for someone else to take charge.


Why the HELL would Trae Young WANT to stay here?

So we have Trae this year and next... and then it is a player option if he wants to return in the 26-27 year or if he wants to be a FA (of course he would).

So with nothing on the horizon to show Trae that we are dedicated to building a winner around him... and no real reason to stay... we will likely then try and trade him NEXT year, theoretically to get something for him instead of just letting him walk.   HOWEVER, as the entire league will know we are scrambling to get some sort of deal... we will once again be dealing from a position of weakness and likely get future draft picks and old washed up players.


So... enjoy the 24-25 season for whatever it will be... likely more of the same middle of the road, not too exciting team we have had for a while...  Because the talk of Trae leaving will be a fever pitch by the end of next year, and no top free agents will be looking to join a team on the down slope toward rock bottom.   26,27,& 28 will surely be crap seasons unless we get very fortunate and strike gold on the draft with an unforseen superstar pick.


This team needs to be blown up YESTERDAY and realize that the rebuild needs to happen NOW.. not in 2 years.  Get something good for Trae NOW and get a young, fresh team that has less ego and less contract and hopefully we can build.  Because for as excellent as Trae is and has been for us... we have squandered that talent and we will not get it back.  Thank you Trae, but it is time to move him to save the club.  Because he has all but told you he wont be staying."
35,Trae this off-season,I usually have very little complaints about Trae and how he conducts himself. He’s been a model player for the Hawks and doesn’t get in trouble off court. This off-season with the malpractice that is the front office of the Hawks Trae has been very distant. He basically hasn’t commented on us getting the #1 pick other than on his podcast and hasn’t made any real statements on Zach. I saw him say he’d be at summer league but I didn’t see him at the game yesterday. Even his dad has been uncharacteristically silent on moves made. I think Landry Fields has created an untinable situation and I think mid season Trae will demand a trade even though I’d personally hate that. We’ve sat on our hands and I think this will be the cost.
36,Minority opinion: FO is making a rational decision about Vit,"Title says it. We can match anyone who wants Vit and we can sign him for 4 years if we wait it out. This team, even with Vit, isn’t going to win anything. I love Vit and want him to be a Hawk but holding pat and keeping Forrest for now isn’t the worst thing in the world: we are talking about our bench unit of all things. The upside for Vit is evident and I would project we’re banking on matching if anyone wants to sign him. Complain if we don’t match him- that could be valid. Otherwise, for now, season is wraps anyways (no Jalen or OO).  We don’t have a first round pick for a couple of years cuz the DJM trade. Let’s get in the lottery and pray 🕯️ 

If you’re still reading thanks and shoutout Landry Fields for drafting Mo Gueye and Bufkin. They both look very promising. Also excited about Lundy he looks great on the Skyhawks. We are fine"
37,Hawks fans how we feel about the Mike Penix Jr pick by the Falcons?,"Are you optimistic or mad

38,I’m a Knicks fan but I come in peace. Just curious how the Atlanta fan base feels about Landy Fields as their GM?,"Im born and raised in NY, a life long Knicks fan but I currently live in Dekalb. Atlanta has been great so far but I haven’t been able to connect with this roster. Something about its construction is a bit off to me.

Im a huge fan of Fields. There was a time where the NY fan base thought Landry Fields was going to develop into an elite role player, almost as great as Derrick White is now. But it didn’t work out in the end. Being in Atlanta now, you guys having the 1st pick in todays draft, and knowing LF is the GM makes me all the more intrigued with this team.

So I’m curious to know how real Hawk fans feel about the job Landry Fields has done thus far.
