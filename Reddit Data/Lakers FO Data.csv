0,Met Jeanie Buss today!,"Jeannie was promoting her tequila brand today, going around Los Angeles to local liquor stores and signing bottles. I live two blocks from the one she did in the valley and she was so so nice. She saw my laker hat and did not make me buy a bottle. That‚Äôs her showing me the In-season tournament championship medallion. You can also see she‚Äôs wearing the 2020 championship ring. Thought I‚Äôd share!"
1,Jeanie Buss is driving this franchise into the ground and she doesn‚Äôt care because she‚Äôs getting her money.,"Our cheapskate piece of shit owner is the common denominator in so many of our problems it‚Äôs genuinely unreal.

She‚Äôs the reason we never got Ty Lue because she was too much of a penny pinching shithead to give him an extra year on his deal, and then she turned around and fucked our chances of getting a respectable head coach because she was so unbelievably disrespectful in how she fired Vogel, leading her to have to give Darvin Ham (one of the worst head coaches the league has seen in years) a 5 year deal to convince him it‚Äôs worth it.

She also decided that money was more important than keeping important players, letting go of fan favourite and one of our most impactful role players in Caruso in favour of THT who‚Äôs now hardly getting playing time on a middling Jazz team. We could have kept both, and she decided she wanted to save some fucking money.

She keeps hiring her friends instead of qualified executives, leading to shit like Kurt and Linda Rambis trying to force Vogel into playing DAJ + Dwight on a consistent basis, which was actually the beginning of the rift between Vogel and the organization. This kind of nepotism is just straight up unacceptable.

Oh and by the way, I have yet to mention maybe the biggest loss she caused, which was Jerry West. The logo of the fucking NBA, one of the pioneers of this franchise, and most importantly one of if not the best GM in league history wanted badly to rejoin the team in 2017, but it was our ownership that elected to employ Magic Johnson instead of him‚Ä¶ a first time GM who went on to be one of the worst in the league. And after this, Jeanie an the Rambii alienated him like their lives depended on it, revoking his season tickets which were given to him by the great Dr. Buss himself. And now, even if you want to say he‚Äôs done some good, she hired Kobe‚Äôs agent who the entire league despised, making it so we have to pay a premium for literally every single trade we want to do, oh and by the way he‚Äôs also the guy who went through with the worst trade maybe in the history of the NBA, regardless if LeBron and AD pulled for it.

Her nepotism, her incompetence, her penny pinching tendencies, all of it is culminating in the complete implosion of our franchise. LeBron is likely going to leave this off season unless we can miraculously turn things around, and if LeBron fucking James elects to leave us, there isn‚Äôt even a remote chance we see stars try to come here because‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ why would they? If they want to come to LA, they‚Äôll go to the Clippers who have an owner who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about money, and have a competent coach and management.

Being a big name franchise doesn‚Äôt mean shit if you‚Äôre not known for winning anymore, just look at the Knicks. The biggest market in the league saw 25 years of failure because everyone knew they were incompetent, and that was WITHOUT a bunch of cheapskates running the show.

Our only hope is if the fanbase comes together in the biggest organized protest the league has ever seen to try and pressure Jeanie to sell, or if LeBron publicly calls for it (which could backfire even worse). Oh and even then, Shaq‚Äôs looking to buy a team, and I don‚Äôt know if Shaq would be any better.

How on earth does this franchise recover from the damage our braindead owner has done?"

11,[More Details] Many within Lakers want Darvin Ham fired and Jeanie Buss detached from Basketball Activities üò±üò±,"A complete breakdown of the Irwin podcast: https://www.lakersground.net/viewtopic.php?p=9320721

There are 19 total bullet points, but here are some of the more interesting ones:

1. Many inside the Lakers believe that simply firing Darvin Ham would turn the season around.

2. Taurean Prince was never promised a starting role before signing with the team; many inside Lakers say it's all Ham's decision and they don't understand the reason behind giving Prince a lot more minutes than any other role players. 

3. The Core 6 guys from last year (LeBron James, Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Austin Reaves, Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura) have felt they were not given enough time and opportunity to work together again like last year. ""It's not like they don't like Prince, it's just the main Core (wasn't given proper time)."" 

4. Reaves being benched was the starting point of the Locker Room disconnect: When Reaves was benched they were taken aback by how quickly Ham moved away from them as a combination. Russell and Reaves are close that when Reaves was inserted back into the starting lineup just recently, you see the light come back to them. Unfortunately, they're also playing with Prince and there isn't a great defender between the 3. 

5. One constant criticism within the Lakers levied to Ham is that he's very close-minded by the type of role player he wants. He tries to pigeon-hole players into roles even if they're not that type of player. Whatever reason this year, you had players slotted into spots that they don't feel they're equipped to fill, and it's being held against them when they don't fill those roles. 

6. Ham's communication with the player all season has not where it needs to be. Open door policy is not really a thing, but Ham should ""open his door occasionally when Austin is knocking on it. You can't keep hiding under your desk"". Ham hasn't been very available to his players, not even to the Core guys that help the Lakers get to the WCF. 

8. There are people in the organization that don't understand what is going on between Ham and Reaves, but now they're also noticing the same thing is happening between Ham and Hachimura, and also between Ham and Vanderbilt. 

10. You see it kind of volatile when there are clips on twitter with guys rolling their eyes while Ham tries to coach them. You watch any timeout right now and it's never 5 guys that Ham is talking to. You don't reach it this visibily broken without a foundational change to one of the parties. The amount of trust and confidence that he feels from Pelinka and Buss, has made Ham feel untouchable. He has legitimately changed as a head coach. 

12. Shams Charania's reporting with Jovan Buha earlier this month (about the disconnect between Ham and the Locker Room) there was 6 sources! And those were only the 6 sources who were willing to come out and say those things on their report. But there are plenty of more sources beyond that.

18. Jeanie Buss, on what process goes into the decisions she makes that has a trickle down effect on the rest of the organization, and she hasn't made a decisions with a good process that is respected (aka she just hires ""friends""). There was no interview process for Magic Johnson, there was no interview process to replace Magic, no interview process for Rob Pelinka. She paired Magic and Pelinka who both have no experience with their jobs. If Pelinka gets fired, who's to say she won't just bring in Kurt Rambis and give him a chance.

19. There are people in the organization biding their time in the process hoping that Jesse and Joey Buss gets a shot. They see what Jeanie is doing and they want to see Jeanie detached from any basketball activity whatsoever and just have Jesse and Joey run them because they have utilized good process in running the South Bay Lakers. And it's heading there sooner rather than people realize. We will start hearing more about Jesse and Joey and that noise will get louder and louder."

In doing so, James‚Äô upcoming offseason decisions will be influenced by his connections with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.‚Äù","Saw this on the timeline, so I thought that I might as well share!

Some highlights from the piece:

* ‚ÄúEarly indications point toward the 20-time All-Star opting out of his contract in order to create flexibility by becoming an unrestricted free agent for what could be the final time in his career, league sources told ClutchPoints. Should LeBron opt out of his contract, the Lakers are not prepared to give up on the league's all-time scorer, as they hope to keep James in Los Angeles until he is ready to retire.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWhile the 21-year veteran has backed off slightly on the narrative of playing alongside his son before he retires when speaking with reporters, James truly wants to play on the same team as Bronny, sources said.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe New Orleans Pelicans do reserve the rights to own the Lakers' 17th overall selection this season, but the belief amongst league circles is that the Pelicans will decline this option for 2025 instead.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe idea of moving on from Ham is another influence on James' decision this offseason, league sources confirmed. Executive Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss are expected to consult with LeBron, among others, before making a final decision on whether Ham will return for his third season with the Lakers. The overwhelming belief across league circles is that the Lakers will fire Ham and look to replace him with a coach who can bring out the championship potential of this roster by being the leading voice in the locker room.‚Äù

* ‚ÄùLeading up to the start of Team USA training camp in July, LeBron is not only expected to opt out of his contract with the Lakers for the 2024-25 season but actively lay out all of his options moving forward, sources said, with Curry and Durant potentially playing a role in what James decides to do.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe possibility of teaming up with the Warriors is something Curry will undoubtedly talk with James about leading up to free agency and the start of Team USA training camp, sources said. With LeBron expected to seriously give thought to other opportunities entering what could be his final free agency, Durant is another voice James will listen to, given the Suns' need for help in their quest for a championship.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWinning a third championship would do a lot for Durant's legacy, and he is going to do what it takes to make this happen. Whether that means he remains in Phoenix or jumps ship to another team is a whole separate conversation.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúCould LeBron leave Los Angeles and head to the desert to create the best quartet this league has ever seen? On the flip side of things, would Durant entertain the idea of requesting a trade from the Suns in order to go to the Lakers?‚Äù üëÄ

* ‚ÄúEven though there is a strong belief that he will ultimately remain with the Lakers, the notion that James is going to give thought to what Curry and Durant have to say to him this offseason is very telling as to what he is thinking. Still, the overarching belief is that James will simply hear out the ideas presented to him rather than seriously consider leaving the Lakers, league sources said. LeBron declining to engage in the trade conversations involving him and the Warriors at the trade deadline gave Buss and the Lakers more confidence that their superstar is not leaving anytime soon.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúNo matter what happens with everything else, the Lakers remain committed to winning, with James being the face of the franchise.‚Äù"

By¬†[Bill Plaschke](https://www.latimes.com/people/bill-plaschke)  
Columnist  
June 12, 2024 4:38 PM PT

The sadness was compounded by the strangeness.

The announcement of the death of the greatest Laker was made by the Clippers.

‚ÄúJerry West, the personification of basketball excellence and a friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully this morning at the age of 86,‚Äù read the Wednesday morning release from the Clippers‚Äô communications department.

The Clippers loved Jerry West, and were loved by him, and he was treated with the utmost dignity and respect during his seven years as their adviser.

But he will forever be a Laker.

He built the Lakers into a Southern California institution as a player. He constructed and nurtured the Lakers‚Äô greatness as a general manager.

He was their conscience. He was their heartbeat. He was their soul. He was the most important person to ever walk through their gym doors.

But in the end, for a variety of reasons, the basketball genius and his creation were estranged.

West walked away from the Lakers 24 years ago and never returned.

It was always so bizarre, the best executive in the history of sports living down the street from an organization he helped build into the most celebrated in sports ‚Ä¶ and yet they didn‚Äôt talk.

The Lakers struggled after the trade of Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal while West watched from Memphis. The Lakers were adrift in the final years of Kobe Bryant while West watched from Golden State. The Lakers were buckling in the early years of LeBron James while West watched from the Clippers.

He was so close, yet so far.

The [Lakers honored him with a statue](https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-feb-17-la-sp-jerry-west-20110218-story.html) in 2011 in an event attended by owner Jerry Buss and all sorts of Lakers royalty. But they continued along separate paths until his death Wednesday poignantly reminded everyone of their divorce.

The Clippers were the first to issue a statement early Wednesday morning, reading, ‚ÄúThe Clippers have lost a mentor, a confidant and a friend.‚Äù

At the same time, Clippers owner [Steve Ballmer issued his own statement](https://x.com/Steven_Ballmer/status/1800942392037523966), writing, ‚ÄúFrom the first day I met Jerry seven years ago, he inspired me with his intellect, honesty and enthusiasm. He never stopped. I spent a lot of time with him, some of the best times of my life. He always lent an ear, and he always had a quip. He always left me laughing. I will miss him.‚Äù

The Lakers‚Äô statement came later, reading, in part, ‚ÄúJerry West is forever a basketball icon ‚Ä¶ Jerry West will always be a Lakers legend.‚Äù

It was nice, but it was four sentences and there was no personalized tribute from a Lakers official until Jeanie Buss issued a short statement on Instagram in the early afternoon.

‚ÄúToday is a difficult day for all Laker fans. I know that if my father were here, he would say that Jerry West was at the heart of all that made the Lakers great. He was an icon to all ‚Äî but he was also a hero to our family. We all send our sympathies to Karen and the West family.‚Äù

Again, it was nice, but compared to past Lakers‚Äô tributes for fallen stars such as Elgin Baylor and Tex Winter, the team‚Äôs response was underwhelming for a man who deserved so much more.

Jerry West was essentially the first Los Angeles Lakers draft pick, as he was the first-round selection of the Minnesota Lakers shortly before they moved to Los Angeles.

It was West and [Elgin Baylor](https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2021-03-22/la-me-elgin-baylor-lakers) who became this city‚Äôs first professional basketball stars. It was [West‚Äôs 63-foot overtime-forcing basket](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-04-29/jerry-west-60-footer-anniversary-lakers-celtics) in the 1970 Finals against the New York Knicks that became one of this city‚Äôs first great sports moments.

He had this city‚Äôs first great sports nickname ‚Äî ‚ÄúMr. Clutch.‚Äù He garnered arguably the highest honor of any athlete in this city‚Äôs history ‚Äî his silhouette is the NBA logo.

Then, after 15 years as a star Lakers player, he became this city‚Äôs first dynasty builder, nurturing the ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù era, then personally building the Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal-Kobe Bryant era by signing Shaq and trading for Kobe.

Tweeted Byron Scott: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of Jerry West that there was even ‚ÄòShowtime.‚Äô‚Äù

Tweeted Magic Johnson: ‚ÄúLaker Nation, the only reason we have 17 championships is because of Jerry West and his expertise drafting players, trading for players, and hiring the right coaches.‚Äù

That expertise has been sorely missing from the Lakers in recent years. In fact, it is one of two occurrences that have led to the current struggles of the once-strong front office.

One could say the slow slide began with the departure of Jerry West and the [death of Jerry Buss](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-me-jerry-buss-20130219-story.html).

When West abruptly left the organization after the 2000 championship, he said his body could no longer take the stress.

‚ÄúEverything around here has taken its toll,‚Äù he told me at the time. ‚ÄúYou see my outside, but you don‚Äôt see my inside, and it‚Äôs just awful in there. This compulsion with winning, it‚Äôs a sickness.‚Äù

But it was about more than winning, it was about how they were winning. Coach Phil Jackson was being given more power. He was also dating the owner‚Äôs daughter, giving Jackson more perceived stature. West was increasingly uncomfortable with dynamics that seemed to be marginalizing his presence.

When West talked of, ‚ÄúEverything around here ‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù much of that was centered on Jackson and Buss.

As the years passed, West became more bitter, and the Lakers became more resentful of his bitterness, and, once Jerry Buss died in 2013, West‚Äôs connections to the club were seemingly gone forever.

One of the final breaking points occurred in 2017, when Jeanie Buss cleared out the front office and hired Rob Pelinka and Magic Johnson to run the team. West had publicly said he would be interested in returning home to join them, but nothing was offered, and so he joined the Clippers.

In his introductory Clippers news conference, he took a veiled shot at the Lakers, saying,‚ÄúMy last stop along the way, \[I want\] to be associated with people who are really basketball people, people I have respect for and, more importantly, I think, an incredible owner.‚Äù

Four years later, the relationship was ruined forever when, on a podcast, [Jeanie Buss named her five most important Lakers ever](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-04-24/jeanie-buss-top-5-lakers).

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Phil Jackson.

West, unarguably the most important Laker ever, wasn‚Äôt even on the list, and he was furious. He was so insulted, he told one media organization that he sometimes wished he had never even played with the Lakers.

‚ÄúOne disappointing thing \[about my career\] is that my relationship with the Lakers is horrible,‚Äù [West said in a 2022 interview with The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3095914/2022/02/01/nba-75-at-no-14-jerry-west-was-mr-clutch-and-forever-will-be-brutally-honest-about-himself/). ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know why. And at the end of the day, when I look back, I say, ‚ÄòWell, maybe I should have played somewhere else instead of with the Lakers, where someone would have at least appreciated how much you give, how much you cared.‚Äô‚Äù

To all this animosity, add the fact that in 2019, the Lakers parted ways with West‚Äôs son Ryan, who was their director of player personnel. Then there was Jerry West‚Äôs claim that the Lakers took away his season tickets, further annoying him.

Amid Wednesday‚Äòs gloom, it was inspirational to see how the Clippers supported Jerry West, with lengthy tributes not only from Ballmer, but also team president Lawrence Frank and Coach Tyronn Lue.

But it was equally sad to see how detached West appeared from the organization he built.

The Lakers still have room on their jerseys for a patch, right? Next year they should wear a JW in his honor.

The Lakers have never dedicated their hardwood, right? Next year they could name it, ‚ÄúJerry West Court.‚Äù

The greatest Laker is gone, but his legacy must not be forgotten.

Especially by the Lakers."
40,I hate this man. ,"^*Christmas game with a healthy AR Dlo Rui off the bench on national tv. Shuda fired him on the spot)*

I rewatched other night's game tryna be objective and just absolutely hate how Darvin Ham seemed like he didn't know how massive that must win game is..

With playoffs just around the corner, typically teams shortens the roster and plays 6-8 *main guys* and gut it out.

Given the terrible luck of ADs injury and Bron's illness, the game was winnable despite the ridiculous barrage of 3 pointers they made. That late 3rd quarter decision to play an experimental lineup is so mind-numbing, even my 12 year old nephew went *""huuuhhhhh""*. Its unbelievable how unserious the lineup looked with Rui AR just chillin on the bench and let his 5 hung to dry, no timeouts too as a 5pt lead turned into 17 in a blink of an eye.

What's even more disturbing is that lack of *urgency* from him the whole game playing 9 guys including wasted minutes on Reddish given how negative he's been since the whole of March. Is this ***the marathon*** he always refers to whole year??

Massive unserious activity from Ham. Hopefuly Jeanie, Buss fam and Rob, take a long look at a mirror and accept the fact that they were wrong on him. Hopefully that game is the last straw to all his blunders as the head coach.

Give him his *marathon* far away from lakers basketball. "

42,"[Woike] If I were a Laker fan, the place that I would look where the Lakers might be able to make a move without completely denting what they currently have on the roster, would be the Utah Jazz.","- The reason I say the Utah Jazz is because they own something from the Lakers. They own the Lakers‚Äô pick 5-30 in the 2027 NBA draft. There is value in engaging with Utah and introducing unprotecting that pick. That does not mean trading for Lauri Markannen but it does mean they can be a potential third team in deals. They are also a team that has some players that the Lakers have been linked to at times like say Collin Sexton. 

- At the end of the day I still think if this team is going to do something it will be more major than minor. It will be something bigger for a starting level player, because otherwise you are just muddying up your bench and taking minutes from young players you are looking to develop.


**What type of players are the Lakers interested in?**

- We know that the team would like a big. Anthony Davis and LeBron James think that getting a big like Jonas Valanciunas would matter. That would be an archetype to get traded is a depth piece in the frontcourt.

- Two-way players. They still need two-way players. Two way guards two way wings, but the demand for those is high.

- They would have signed Spencer Dinwiddie if they traded D‚ÄôAngelo Russell.



**Is there a limit to Jeanie Buss‚Äô patience with Rob Pelinka?**

- I think yes. I don‚Äôt exactly know where that limit is. I know Jeanie wants to win. When you talk to Jeanie about her job she mentions he father a lot and she mentions titles. The team has had a pretty stable lineage of execs and front office people and I think there is a lot of loyalty to Rob Pelinka for a lot of reasons. And he won a title. I don‚Äôt know what level of credit he deserves for this but he reinvigorated the franchise. Signed LeBron. Brought in AD.

- As far as the patience moving forward I think it‚Äôs being tested. These next handful of decisions are very important. I think that‚Äôs why you see Pelinka take a lot of ownership of the recent coaching and player personnel decisions. Making it clear that these are my decisions. I think that‚Äôs because his fate is at stake.


**Other notes‚Ä¶**

- Jalen Hood-Schfino is doing well. He was practicing with the summer league team and based on what I heard in Vegas I would be surprised if he‚Äôs not ready by training camp.

- The Lakers have a very thin front office with no college or league-wide scouting department. They are not as plugged on some of this stuff around the margins. I spend some time pregame with a lot of teams before games scouting shootaround, gathering intel. The Lakers don‚Äôt do that."

"
57,What's there to look forward to?,"No, honestly.

Our rosters a mess, the role players we have signed long term fall a part during the playoffs. Lebron should retire next season, AD is on the wrong side of 30 and I'm pretty sure the right move for him is to ask for a trade at this point. Our coaching staff is dog water, the only good coach has already said he was going to leave before the season began. Most likely waiting for Bron. The medical staff is even worst, we went the entire season without most of our roster. We're led by a front office that puts more stock into a good story or straight up nepotism.

Who's even available for us to get? How much of our depth are we going to throw away to get a ball dominant player who can't defend like Trey Young? Which is sadly the best case scenario.

I'm gonna get real here for a second. I'm a Laker fan and I watch because at the very least Lakers basketball is fun to watch. Nothing in the near or distant future of this team seems like it's going to be fun.

I'm getting to that age that people in my life are starting to pass away. I have buried more people that I've grown up with this year then I have ever in my entire life due to age or sickness. I've come to the realization that I'm not wasting any more of my time watching a team that doesn't give a shit. That doesn't learn from their mistakes and grow. Why would I want to waste 3 hours of my life being frustrated every other day?

I mean best case scenario they blow everything up and we go in a complete rebuild phase. But then how many years until we're somewhat good again? They handled the Lebron era horribly.

If the Buss family doesn't sell the team then at the very least Jeanie needs to step back and let Joey and Jessie have a more hands on approach about how our roster is built and ran. They're the only ones who care about this team enough to put in the work to learn the game on a macro level.

I watched during the 2010's and I have never been this frustrated with this team. As of right now I am over it."

He would‚Äôve had a year off, gets to be in LA and most importantly will get a long leash to start fresh with honestly a much better situation than he left in GS. We get some firsts back this offseason and will have quite a few trade/sign and trade guys on roster. After that he‚Äôll get to oversee the rebuild.
"
59,Why are people continuously saying the Lakers are in a tight salary situation next season?,"I've been reading around about the D'Angelo trade situation and a lot of people are making it seem like the trade needs to happen for some apron related reason.

To me, that just seems weird.

If D'Angelo opts into his player-option, this is what the Lakers salary looks like next season --

&nbsp;

Player Name | Cap amount (or cap-hold amount)
:-- | :-- 
LeBron James | $51.4m (player option)
Anthony Davis | $43.2m
D'Angelo Russell | $18.7m (player option)
Rui Hachimura | $17m
Austin Reaves | $13m
Gabe Vincent | $11m
Jarred Vanderbilt | $10.7m
Taurean Prince | $5.4m (cap-hold)
Jalen Hood-Schifino | $3.9m
Christian Wood | $3m (player option)
Jaxson Hayes | $2.5m (player option)
Cam Reddish | $2.5m (player option)
Max Christie | $2.3m (cap-hold)
Maxwell Lewis | $1.9m
**Total payroll** | **$186.4m**
**Projected cap** | **$142m**
**Luxury tax cut-off** | **$172m**
**Luxury tax apron (first apron)** | **$179m**
**Second apron** | **$190m**

&nbsp;

That's a 14 man roster that comes in ~$3.6m below the second apron which is basically a full roster.  That seems fine.

If they need to save some money, they can replace Taurean Prince with a minimum exception player and look for a bargain on Christie.  If Taurean Prince decides to leave, the Lakers can also replace him with a TPMLE signing at a similar contract value.

Wood is likely to opt out.  Hayes might also.  Given his current role with the team, unless Cam loses his minutes, I could see him opting in.  In any case, those guys will get replaced by minimums or SRPs which saves a little bit of money.  Doing all that would drop the Lakers to ~$181.9m or less depending on the type of minimums signed.

So, in terms of the second apron, D'Angelo opting in does not really matter.

IMO, there is no reason to be concerned with the first apron unless you are hard-capping yourself at it by using the full MLE or BAE.

Currently, the Lakers are still paying the luxury tax.  So, they need to dump a little bit of salary if their goal is to avoid paying any luxury tax this season and open a 2-year window to reset their repeater penalty.

If they do that, then it makes some financial sense to trade D'Angelo to prevent him from opting in and pushing the team over the tax cut-off next season  If he opts out or is traded for expiring money, then the Lakers will be able to avoid paying the luxury tax next season to fully reset their repeater penalty for a regular tax window of 3 years.

The main issue with salary dumping D'Angelo is obviously the impact on the competitiveness of the team.  Dropping him would bring the team's salary to $167.7m.  Even if they also drop Taurean Prince and a save some money on a few of their minimum exceptions, it'll still be unlikely they'll even have the full MLE to offer without going over the tax cut-off again.

---

Now, for my personal opinion, I think the way they handled the last off-season made sense.  I don't think it's worth it to recklessly push above the second apron even if you have that type of money to spend and most bigger spenders in the NBA agreed with that.  The difference between being above or below the first apron is your options for signing FAs -- being above the first apron, you only have the smaller TPMLE to use but have ~$17m more in total salary space.  Being below it, you have the full MLE and the BAE but are capped at a lower amount of total salary.  So, if you're trying to attact FAs, it's much better to operate under the first apron if that's possible and you can fit everything below the first apron.

But, next season, I don't think it makes sense to try and operate under the first apron because the other salaries on this team means they can't use the full MLE.  Unless they shed even more salary, the main benefits to being under the first apron just aren't there.  The only reason you'd do it is to save some luxury tax money.  If you're really trying to reset your repeater tax status during LeBron's remaining window and AD's prime, then you just aren't a serious team."
60,"The lakers just came off an impressive conference finals run and an in-season tournament win, there is a 0% chance Lakers FO fires Darvin Ham before the season ends.","If you‚Äôve paid attention to the way Jeanie and Pelinka have operated this franchise, you should know that this is true.  Unless it is an obvious decision to make, Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka always have been hesitant to make drastic changes, especially mid-season. Yall need to relax. Ham is going no where and us fans have no control over the situation so there‚Äôs no point."
61,"The NBA informed teams today that it is projecting the 2024-25 salary cap to be $141 million ‚Äî $1M lower than previous June 30, 2023 projection. The salary cap this season was set for $136M.","Also from Woj: ESPN Sources: Projected 2024-2025 NBA salary cap levels: Minimum Team Salary: $127 million Tax Level: $172 million First Apron Level: $179 million Second Apron Level: $190 million

https://x.com/ShamsCharania/status/1752398273690665207?s=20 

Why this matters: 

Going into next season we've got a salary of 178.8m if Bron, Dlo, Wood, Hayes, and Reddish accept their options. 

If Bron/Dlo accept theirs and the rest move on, we're at roughly 174m.

This means we're right up against the apron level pretty much from the outset of the season next year. It would behoove us to dip under that repeater tax now because we're unlikely to have another opportunity until after LeBron retires. 

If Bron/Dlo opt out and leave in the summer and the minimum guys leave too, the maximum amount we'd have on the books is roughly 106.5m meaning we'd have about 34.5m to spend to put around AD, AR, Rui, Vincent, Vando, JHS, and Lewis. We could get to a max slot fairly easily by moving any of Reaves, Rui, Vincent, or Vando.

For those curious the rough max amounts next year will be around  35m, 42m, and 50m depending on how many years you've been in the league."

63,Lakers‚Äô biggest problem is the culture and lack of consistency.,"Sorry this post is long, so I put the TLDR at the beginning: 

The Russ trade doomed the Bron era - Lakers should‚Äôve kept the 2020-2021 core and made moves on the margins. We need to pick a direction for this team, stop being a revolving door of players and coaches, and focus on consistency and continuity from top to bottom.

Actual Post:

I‚Äôve been thinking about the LeBron era on LA and how many years we were actually in contention for a championship. I‚Äôd say obviously 2019-2020, then 2020-2021, then somehow last season when we made the Conference Finals. How is it that we have the greatest player (or second greatest depending on who you ask) player of all time in LeBron James, and the best defender in the NBA in Anthony Davis, but are always scratching our way into the playoffs?

For me, I think the answer is the culture the Lakers have, which has resulted in absolutely no continuity. Personally I believe that the Westbrook trade doomed the LeBron era. Not because Russ is a bad player (he‚Äôs not and was extremely scapegoated). But why was the Westbrook trade made? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but wasn‚Äôt it because we lost to the Suns in the 2021 playoffs, even though our entire team was dealing with multiple injuries? Then that summer we trade our entire team for Russ, a player that WE weren‚Äôt even guarding in the bubble. I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs cuz Bron wanted him, but that fit was never gonna work. It resulted in probably the worst season in Lakers history in 2022 and we were miraculously able to salvage things last season. However, I think that the Russ trade was a huge symptom of the Lakers‚Äô biggest problem - our culture.

The Lakers‚Äô culture is win at all costs. Obviously every team wants to win, but with Lakers, if we aren‚Äôt winning despite any and all circumstances, we‚Äôre trying to get rid of people. I get that we‚Äôre the Lakers and we‚Äôve won for decades, so we expect winning basketball. However, this culture has warped into whenever a player misses a shot, they‚Äôre on the trade block and our players fans are harassing them and calling for them to be traded. Our front office‚Äôs incompetence doesn‚Äôt help either. We have been a revolving door of players and coaches since LeBron arrived. (Not blaming Bron btw I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs here).

Think of all the players we let go and begged the Lakers to trade the past few seasons who would be perfect on this team. Even back when we had Julius Randle, we just let him walk even though he was a restricted free agent. Then Magic traded Zubac for a penny. We let Brook Lopez and Caruso go who were willing to take discounts to stay with us. Then we begged for KCP and Kuz to be traded. Danny Green and Russell Westbrook got harassed the worst. But players like KCP, Kuz, Caruso, and Brook Lopez would be perfect on this team.

Not to mention our coaching decisions. We lowballed Ty Lue before hiring Vogel. We were able to win a chip with Vogel because we had a roster that played to his strenghts as a coach. The next season, we get rid of all of his defensive assets, give him a team of aging all-offense players, then call him a trash coach and fire him as the scapegoat. We were expecting him to turn water into wine with that horrible roster.

We were able to salvage the roster last season, and make the conference finals, but now we‚Äôre running into the same problem we always do. I wholeheartedly understand that players have been underperforming. However, it‚Äôs like we forget these players are people, and that this isn‚Äôt 2k. 

Players go through slumps, players have bad games, players miss shots, and when this stuff happens, the answer isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúthis player is trash get them off my team now!‚Äù These players have lives, they can see what people post about them. I think a big example is JHS. No he‚Äôs not NBA ready, but it looks like he‚Äôs especially playing scared cuz he knows if he plays bad, he‚Äôll get clowned and harassed on social media. I think it‚Äôs the same for the rest of the roster outside of Bron and AD because there‚Äôs no security. I think that contributes to their lack of effort sometimes too. How can they play free and winning basketball when they‚Äôre worried about being harassed and traded if they miss a shot?

With all that being said, I am not absolving Darvin for his bad coaching decisions, the players for their lack of effort, the fact that we never practice, and the front office for its past mistakes. I agree that we do need a trade, but not for Lavine or another star cuz it would be the same thing as the Russ situation. Yes it‚Äôs a better fit, but the contract would prevent us from doing anything if another player becomes available or if Lavine ends up getting hurt. 

I still believe this team can make the playoffs with or without a trade, but I don‚Äôt want us giving up half our roster for one player again. That never has worked and never will work. I think the only thing that saves the lakers is continuity and consistency from EVERYONE. We need a consistent roster, consistent coaching, and to stop screaming for trades after every missed shot. Yes we need to make changes this year, but whatever we decide to do, we need to stick with it and give it a chance. 

If we fire Darvin, make sure the next coach is the one we want to stick with. The front office needs to make sure the coach compliments the roster, and vice versa. No more firing coaches after two seasons, no more trading young players for aging stars (unless it‚Äôs too good to pass up). Make a vision for how this team wants to play, get a coach who supports that vision, and build a roster according to that vision.

98,Lakers got fleeced that year,
99,Is it time to have a Rob Pelinka conversation? Feels like we have to make trades every year because of our FA dont work out?,"We had the formula to win in 2020 play with two bigs, live in the paint and everyone else had a strict role. Like who takes the blame for hiring Ham? Signing Gabe Vincent and letting Shroeder and Lonnie go. We have too many guys that do one thing and only one thing. The worst thing that happened to us was losing to the Suns in the first round a couple of years ago and ripping up what was a great core."
100,[Mike Trudell] Rob Pelinka Weighs In On Knecht Pick,
101,Rob Pelinka is given access to a time machine‚Ä¶,"And with it he is allowed to go back to any year in Laker history and bring a role player back with him to join the current roster.

Who‚Äôs jumping in that time machine with you?


For the sake of this exercise let‚Äôs define role player as a non-top 3 player on the team. (Which opens up the question of who is the third best player on the 2020 team or the Kobe/Shaq dynasty)

Give me Michael Cooper. DPOY-level wing defense plus competent shooting. Can you imagine Coop x Vando x Bron x AD defensive death lineups?"
102,Rob Pelinka let all of our two way players go for one dimensional players. Darvin Scam and Roster construction is our biggest problem.,"We used to have 2 way guards with two bigs who could protect the paint. Danny Green, AC, KCP, Dennis were all two way guards. Losing AC for NOTHING, hurts so bad to this day. If he was on this roster he‚Äôd solve so many issues on defense and be able to lock up guards which we cannot do. Bron is 39 and not 28 anymore when he could lock up anyone 1-5.  Kyle Kuzma was starting to use his length to guard taller players well, Bron could play elite D when he wanted and then we had DPOY in AD. Javale and Dwight held down the paint and AD / Bron could almost play free safety. Vando although he showed flashes on offense before his injury and Reddish are solely defensive players and do not offer much on O. Rui is the only player who offers something on both ends but is not the best individual defender either. Prince is far from a good defender as well. 

Now, AD basically alone needs to cover for AR / D-Lo who can‚Äôt stay in front of a quick guard if their life depended on it. Watching fox and monk last night, one step and one dribble and they were already past D-Lo and AR and in the paint. 

AD has to slide over to help and that leads to an easy layup for a big, or AD being out of position so Sabonis can rebound or tap it out and everyone screams at AD. It‚Äôs not ADs fault that our guards can‚Äôt stay in front of anyone. People loved to shit on AD for not rebounding but what the fuck do you expect him to do? He is helping protect for AR and D-Lo‚Äôs lack of D and is always out of position. 

It‚Äôs also not ADs fault Ham exclusively uses him at the 5, however it‚Äôs been seen we play extremely well when we pair a competent paint protector with AD. Javale and Howard in 2020 and then Gasol in 2021. AD has constantly said he didn‚Äôt want to exclusively play 5 but the Westbrook trade forced us to do just that. Essentially we chose to accommodate Russ over AD, bad bad move. 

The extra weight has had to add and extra bumps and bruises AD takes everyday at 5 on his body has slowed him down. Watch 2020 or Pelicans AD, he‚Äôd blow by other bigs at will. Now instead of trying to go around bigs he tries to play physical but that‚Äôs not his game, period. Jokic, Sabonis, Embiid, always seem to get the best of him bc they play physical. Watching the Nuggets game where AD wasn‚Äôt blowing by Jokic at will was sad. Go watch 2020. AD would toy with Jokic. AD was our leading scorer in 3 out of the 5 games, averaged 31 on 55% shooting and Jokic couldn‚Äôt guard him for shit. 

It still hurts to see such major mis-management. We had a roster stacked full of two way players and now solely have one dimensional players save for Bron and AD."
103,Rob Pelinka‚Äôs the main culprit,"All across this subreddit i see criticism of Ham and how he‚Äôs a terrible coach which is probably true, I trust you guys on that since I don‚Äôt watch laker games. I just can‚Äôt understand why Pelinka‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt brought up as frequently here with due to the fact that he put this roster together. I mean aside from AD and Bron, this team is awful. Literally a group of 2nd/ 3rd string players and this is the team that LeBron is supposed to carry at 39 years old? Pelinka has to get the same criticism, if not more because this roster is not good enough. Feels like he‚Äôs riding of last years team which over-performed and i don‚Äôt say this to try and bash the laker community, I just can‚Äôt see how any coach is supposed to work with this roster. Hopefully change is coming for the better for you guys"

108,Surrounding LeBron/AD with new players next year alone won‚Äôt get them past Denver. Changes need to be made at the Top. Whether that Top starts at Darvin Ham or goes higher to Rob Pelinka or Jeanie Buss is the real question.,
109,"[Wojnarowski] Rob Pelinka and Jeanie Buss are eager to formally discuss their vision with Hurley of marrying his dominant program --- built upon both his tactical acumen and elite player development -- to the storied Lakers‚Äô brand, sources tell ESPN.",
110,"[Brett Siegel] ‚ÄúLeBron James is expected to opt out of his contract with the Lakers to become a free agent, sources told @ClutchPoints.  In doing so, James‚Äô upcoming offseason decisions will be influenced by his connections with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.‚Äù","Saw this on the timeline, so I thought that I might as well share!

Some highlights from the piece:

* ‚ÄúEarly indications point toward the 20-time All-Star opting out of his contract in order to create flexibility by becoming an unrestricted free agent for what could be the final time in his career, league sources told ClutchPoints. Should LeBron opt out of his contract, the Lakers are not prepared to give up on the league's all-time scorer, as they hope to keep James in Los Angeles until he is ready to retire.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWhile the 21-year veteran has backed off slightly on the narrative of playing alongside his son before he retires when speaking with reporters, James truly wants to play on the same team as Bronny, sources said.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe New Orleans Pelicans do reserve the rights to own the Lakers' 17th overall selection this season, but the belief amongst league circles is that the Pelicans will decline this option for 2025 instead.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe idea of moving on from Ham is another influence on James' decision this offseason, league sources confirmed. Executive Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss are expected to consult with LeBron, among others, before making a final decision on whether Ham will return for his third season with the Lakers. The overwhelming belief across league circles is that the Lakers will fire Ham and look to replace him with a coach who can bring out the championship potential of this roster by being the leading voice in the locker room.‚Äù

* ‚ÄùLeading up to the start of Team USA training camp in July, LeBron is not only expected to opt out of his contract with the Lakers for the 2024-25 season but actively lay out all of his options moving forward, sources said, with Curry and Durant potentially playing a role in what James decides to do.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúThe possibility of teaming up with the Warriors is something Curry will undoubtedly talk with James about leading up to free agency and the start of Team USA training camp, sources said. With LeBron expected to seriously give thought to other opportunities entering what could be his final free agency, Durant is another voice James will listen to, given the Suns' need for help in their quest for a championship.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúWinning a third championship would do a lot for Durant's legacy, and he is going to do what it takes to make this happen. Whether that means he remains in Phoenix or jumps ship to another team is a whole separate conversation.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúCould LeBron leave Los Angeles and head to the desert to create the best quartet this league has ever seen? On the flip side of things, would Durant entertain the idea of requesting a trade from the Suns in order to go to the Lakers?‚Äù üëÄ

* ‚ÄúEven though there is a strong belief that he will ultimately remain with the Lakers, the notion that James is going to give thought to what Curry and Durant have to say to him this offseason is very telling as to what he is thinking. Still, the overarching belief is that James will simply hear out the ideas presented to him rather than seriously consider leaving the Lakers, league sources said. LeBron declining to engage in the trade conversations involving him and the Warriors at the trade deadline gave Buss and the Lakers more confidence that their superstar is not leaving anytime soon.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúNo matter what happens with everything else, the Lakers remain committed to winning, with James being the face of the franchise.‚Äù"

* Max Christie
* Talen Horton-Tucker

If you add in Magic, the year before he drafted: 

- Lonzo Ball 

... which a lot of stats states is also a combo guard. So Lakers technically have been drafting big / combo guards in all their drafts since.

Also notice the years in between where Lakers didn't draft anyone, Rob has made a lot of trades or signings for combo guards too:

**Traded for or Signed:**

* Gabe Vincent
* Kendrick Nunn
* D'angelo Russell
* Patrick Beverley
* Russell Westbrook

How is it his fault that players decide they don't want to take our better offers, or that other teams tend to demand more from the Lakers in a trade than they do other trades?

This ain't just Rob's fault, teams have been crazy stingy with us ever since the Gasol deal. That's what it means to be a Laker fan at this point.

128,[McMenamin] Rob Pelinka on the trade deadline: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt buy a house that‚Äôs not for sale‚Äù,
129,"Buha: ""With LeBron interested in taking a pay cut for the right free agent and the Lakers armed with multiple mid-sized salaries and two valuable first-round picks to trade, there is no excuse for LA to not dramatically improve its roster over the next few days:""",">If James takes a discount for the Lakers to access their full nontaxpayer midlevel exception, the Lakers will be hard-capped at the first apron of $178.7 million. That means James would have to take a $16-plus million discount, with his starting salary at about just over $33 million for the 2024-25 season. The most likely pay cut scenario would be James signing a two-year deal with a player option for 2025-26, allowing him to opt out in 2025 and re-sign for more money, according to league sources. The Lakers could also perform a smaller salary-dump trade (or two) to create more financial wiggle room and allow James to take a smaller decrease.

>If the Lakers don‚Äôt land a star or high-level starter with their nontaxpayer midlevel exception, James will sign the max, according to ESPN. If LeBron re-signs at his max for 2024-25 (approximately $49.9 million), the Lakers will have roughly $182.3 million in committed salary. That puts them less than $8 million under the second apron ($189.5 million). James also wants to have his contract resolved before he starts practicing at the U.S. men‚Äôs Olympic basketball minicamp on July 6 in Las Vegas.

>Regardless of what happens with James and the Lakers‚Äô exceptions, though, the Lakers are well-positioned to upgrade their roster if they so choose. The proverbial ball is in their court regarding how the rest of this offseason unfolds.

>Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka tempered expectations earlier in the week ‚Äî twice ‚Äî by saying trades are harder to execute under the NBA‚Äôs new collective bargaining agreement. At face value, that‚Äôs true, considering the new punitive restrictions of the first and second aprons.

>At the same time, the trade activity over the past week, especially near the top of the Western Conference, paints a different reality. In that time, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded for defensive ace Alex Caruso, the Minnesota Timberwolves traded for No. 8 pick Rob Dillingham, the Denver Nuggets traded up for DaRon Holmes II and salary-dumped Reggie Jackson to try to retain Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, the Dallas Mavericks salary-dumped Tim Hardaway Jr. so they can keep starter Derrick Jones Jr. (or sign Thompson) and the New Orleans Pelicans made a shrewd deal for former Lakers target Dejounte Murray.

>The rest of the West is finding ways to make trades that improve their rosters or act as precursors to other moves. It‚Äôs now on the Lakers to do the same.

>They have the assets to make a notable trade. Russell‚Äôs $18.7 million contract offers them a level of flexibility in terms of the types of players they can pursue. Add in one or both of their future first-round picks, as many as three pick swaps and the mid-sized salaries of Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt and/or Gabe Vincent, and the Lakers can get in the conversation for just about any non-star (and even some lower-end stars). That is, again, before factoring in the potential addition of Thompson or another high-impact player for their nontaxpayer midlevel exception.

>Still, there are good options potentially out there. Wings like Portland‚Äôs Jerami Grant, former Laker Kyle Kuzma and the Nets‚Äô duo of Dorian Finney-Smith and Cam Johnson are expected to be available on the trade market, according to league sources. They aren‚Äôt the biggest needle-movers, but any of those four players would enhance the Lakers‚Äô perimeter defense, frontcourt size and/or floor spacing. Grant, for his part, would check each of those boxes; he‚Äôs quietly shot 40-plus percent on 3s in back-to-back seasons in Portland.

>The Lakers roster, as currently constructed, is simply not good enough to come out of the Western Conference. They can win a round and maybe even two if the bracket breaks in their favor, but they have too many holes compared to the rest of the top of the West, especially on the wing. Their perimeter size, defense and overall speed and athleticism are lacking compared to their competition. James and Davis made it known recently they believe this roster needs upgrades.

>The Timberwolves, Thunder, Mavericks and Pelicans all have better rosters than the ones they finished last season. Denver‚Äôs standing could change if it loses Caldwell-Pope in free agency and the Clippers will likely fall off if they lose Paul George, but the larger point is the rest of the West is revamping, potentially creating even more distance between them and the Lakers. If the Lakers are as serious about competing for championships with James and Davis as they claim to be, they must bolster this supporting cast.

130,"[Buha] The Lakers are preaching patience that the right trade will eventually materialize while betting that healthier versions of Vanderbilt and Vincent, the addition of Knecht and the promotion of Christie into the rotation will shore up the group‚Äôs perimeter defense, athleticism and shooting.","> The inability to develop a young talent like Christie was one of the many internal grievances with Ham, who would be fired a few days after the season. Several Lakers stakeholders believed Christie‚Äôs shooting, rebounding and point-of-attack defense were traits the Lakers could have used against Denver.

> Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka and new head coach JJ Redick sold Christie on their development plan for him next season and beyond.

> While in Las Vegas for two weeks watching younger brother Cam play in summer league after being drafted by the crosstown LA Clippers, Christie spent time with Redick at the team‚Äôs summer league practices. The two spoke extensively about his role next season, including how the Lakers plan to use him as a cutter and a shooting weapon coming off pindowns. Redick directed drills and walked Christie through various actions in multiple workouts.

> To prepare for his increased role, Christie has been working on making reads off closeouts at various parts of the floor. He‚Äôs familiar with that task considering spot-up play has been his primary offensive responsibility as a Laker, but he‚Äôs aiming to perform the role at a much higher level next season.

> Christie has worked with the Lakers‚Äô coaching and player development staff to become a more disruptive defender. He wants to make ballhandlers more uncomfortable, leading to them wasting the shot clock, picking up their dribble and/or moving the ball elsewhere. At the end of each workout, Christie goes through a set of defensive drills designed to test his stamina and mental fortitude when his legs are gone and his breath is short."

139,The Lakers will never be dominant until new ownership arrives,"This isn't to say they won't contend or even win championships. This is still a decent team that is fun to watch that has stars and role players that can beat any team. It's arguable with even an average coach the Lakers would've been a western finalist again.

But until they change ownership (Guggenheim, Bezos, Jensen Huang) they will trail behind other organizations such as the Nuggets, Celtics, Warriors, and Mavericks and they'll have to overcome their strategic acumen with the power of their brand, city location and historical prestige. 

This is not an indictment on Rob Pelinka. Pelinka is inconsistent but he was brought in because of friendships. This is an indictment on Jeanie Buss and her siblings, and the lack of a non nepo adult in the room a la a Bob Myers or Brad Stevens. This team is in need of new blood for ownership the way the Dodgers got Mark Walter and Andrew Friedman. Otherwise, this team is becoming the NBA equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys within ten years sans 2020's title year, which unfortunately is going to embolden the current regime to think they know ball well enough."
140,[More Details] Many within Lakers want Darvin Ham fired and Jeanie Buss detached from Basketball Activities üò±üò±,"A complete breakdown of the Irwin podcast: https://www.lakersground.net/viewtopic.php?p=9320721

There are 19 total bullet points, but here are some of the more interesting ones:

1. Many inside the Lakers believe that simply firing Darvin Ham would turn the season around.

2. Taurean Prince was never promised a starting role before signing with the team; many inside Lakers say it's all Ham's decision and they don't understand the reason behind giving Prince a lot more minutes than any other role players. 

3. The Core 6 guys from last year (LeBron James, Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, Austin Reaves, Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura) have felt they were not given enough time and opportunity to work together again like last year. ""It's not like they don't like Prince, it's just the main Core (wasn't given proper time)."" 

4. Reaves being benched was the starting point of the Locker Room disconnect: When Reaves was benched they were taken aback by how quickly Ham moved away from them as a combination. Russell and Reaves are close that when Reaves was inserted back into the starting lineup just recently, you see the light come back to them. Unfortunately, they're also playing with Prince and there isn't a great defender between the 3. 

5. One constant criticism within the Lakers levied to Ham is that he's very close-minded by the type of role player he wants. He tries to pigeon-hole players into roles even if they're not that type of player. Whatever reason this year, you had players slotted into spots that they don't feel they're equipped to fill, and it's being held against them when they don't fill those roles. 

6. Ham's communication with the player all season has not where it needs to be. Open door policy is not really a thing, but Ham should ""open his door occasionally when Austin is knocking on it. You can't keep hiding under your desk"". Ham hasn't been very available to his players, not even to the Core guys that help the Lakers get to the WCF. 

8. There are people in the organization that don't understand what is going on between Ham and Reaves, but now they're also noticing the same thing is happening between Ham and Hachimura, and also between Ham and Vanderbilt. 

10. You see it kind of volatile when there are clips on twitter with guys rolling their eyes while Ham tries to coach them. You watch any timeout right now and it's never 5 guys that Ham is talking to. You don't reach it this visibily broken without a foundational change to one of the parties. The amount of trust and confidence that he feels from Pelinka and Buss, has made Ham feel untouchable. He has legitimately changed as a head coach. 

12. Shams Charania's reporting with Jovan Buha earlier this month (about the disconnect between Ham and the Locker Room) there was 6 sources! And those were only the 6 sources who were willing to come out and say those things on their report. But there are plenty of more sources beyond that.

18. Jeanie Buss, on what process goes into the decisions she makes that has a trickle down effect on the rest of the organization, and she hasn't made a decisions with a good process that is respected (aka she just hires ""friends""). There was no interview process for Magic Johnson, there was no interview process to replace Magic, no interview process for Rob Pelinka. She paired Magic and Pelinka who both have no experience with their jobs. If Pelinka gets fired, who's to say she won't just bring in Kurt Rambis and give him a chance.

19. There are people in the organization biding their time in the process hoping that Jesse and Joey Buss gets a shot. They see what Jeanie is doing and they want to see Jeanie detached from any basketball activity whatsoever and just have Jesse and Joey run them because they have utilized good process in running the South Bay Lakers. And it's heading there sooner rather than people realize. We will start hearing more about Jesse and Joey and that noise will get louder and louder."
141,LeBron Calls Rui Hachmura His ‚ÄúUnderstudy‚Äù,Pelinka and Coach Ham also mentioned that Rui and LeBron have been doing two a day workouts for months together. I feel like a massive Rui season is coming up!
142,"[Lowe] ""I just want people to tell me, what is the trade the Lakers could have made that closes the gap between them and the best teams in the West. If you look at all the players that got traded today, I don't think any of them close that gap. In the summer, they have more stuff to trade.""",

144, Laker legend Jerry West‚Äôs final legacy sadly includes estrangement from Lakers,"[https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2024-06-12/jerry-west-farewell-bill-plaschke](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2024-06-12/jerry-west-farewell-bill-plaschke)

By¬†[Bill Plaschke](https://www.latimes.com/people/bill-plaschke)  
Columnist  
June 12, 2024 4:38 PM PT

The sadness was compounded by the strangeness.

The announcement of the death of the greatest Laker was made by the Clippers.

‚ÄúJerry West, the personification of basketball excellence and a friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully this morning at the age of 86,‚Äù read the Wednesday morning release from the Clippers‚Äô communications department.

The Clippers loved Jerry West, and were loved by him, and he was treated with the utmost dignity and respect during his seven years as their adviser.

But he will forever be a Laker.

He built the Lakers into a Southern California institution as a player. He constructed and nurtured the Lakers‚Äô greatness as a general manager.

He was their conscience. He was their heartbeat. He was their soul. He was the most important person to ever walk through their gym doors.

But in the end, for a variety of reasons, the basketball genius and his creation were estranged.

West walked away from the Lakers 24 years ago and never returned.

It was always so bizarre, the best executive in the history of sports living down the street from an organization he helped build into the most celebrated in sports ‚Ä¶ and yet they didn‚Äôt talk.

The Lakers struggled after the trade of Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal while West watched from Memphis. The Lakers were adrift in the final years of Kobe Bryant while West watched from Golden State. The Lakers were buckling in the early years of LeBron James while West watched from the Clippers.

He was so close, yet so far.

The [Lakers honored him with a statue](https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2011-feb-17-la-sp-jerry-west-20110218-story.html) in 2011 in an event attended by owner Jerry Buss and all sorts of Lakers royalty. But they continued along separate paths until his death Wednesday poignantly reminded everyone of their divorce.

The Clippers were the first to issue a statement early Wednesday morning, reading, ‚ÄúThe Clippers have lost a mentor, a confidant and a friend.‚Äù

At the same time, Clippers owner [Steve Ballmer issued his own statement](https://x.com/Steven_Ballmer/status/1800942392037523966), writing, ‚ÄúFrom the first day I met Jerry seven years ago, he inspired me with his intellect, honesty and enthusiasm. He never stopped. I spent a lot of time with him, some of the best times of my life. He always lent an ear, and he always had a quip. He always left me laughing. I will miss him.‚Äù

The Lakers‚Äô statement came later, reading, in part, ‚ÄúJerry West is forever a basketball icon ‚Ä¶ Jerry West will always be a Lakers legend.‚Äù

It was nice, but it was four sentences and there was no personalized tribute from a Lakers official until Jeanie Buss issued a short statement on Instagram in the early afternoon.

‚ÄúToday is a difficult day for all Laker fans. I know that if my father were here, he would say that Jerry West was at the heart of all that made the Lakers great. He was an icon to all ‚Äî but he was also a hero to our family. We all send our sympathies to Karen and the West family.‚Äù

Again, it was nice, but compared to past Lakers‚Äô tributes for fallen stars such as Elgin Baylor and Tex Winter, the team‚Äôs response was underwhelming for a man who deserved so much more.

Jerry West was essentially the first Los Angeles Lakers draft pick, as he was the first-round selection of the Minnesota Lakers shortly before they moved to Los Angeles.

It was West and [Elgin Baylor](https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2021-03-22/la-me-elgin-baylor-lakers) who became this city‚Äôs first professional basketball stars. It was [West‚Äôs 63-foot overtime-forcing basket](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-04-29/jerry-west-60-footer-anniversary-lakers-celtics) in the 1970 Finals against the New York Knicks that became one of this city‚Äôs first great sports moments.

He had this city‚Äôs first great sports nickname ‚Äî ‚ÄúMr. Clutch.‚Äù He garnered arguably the highest honor of any athlete in this city‚Äôs history ‚Äî his silhouette is the NBA logo.

Then, after 15 years as a star Lakers player, he became this city‚Äôs first dynasty builder, nurturing the ‚ÄúShowtime‚Äù era, then personally building the Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal-Kobe Bryant era by signing Shaq and trading for Kobe.

Tweeted Byron Scott: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of Jerry West that there was even ‚ÄòShowtime.‚Äô‚Äù

Tweeted Magic Johnson: ‚ÄúLaker Nation, the only reason we have 17 championships is because of Jerry West and his expertise drafting players, trading for players, and hiring the right coaches.‚Äù

That expertise has been sorely missing from the Lakers in recent years. In fact, it is one of two occurrences that have led to the current struggles of the once-strong front office.

One could say the slow slide began with the departure of Jerry West and the [death of Jerry Buss](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-me-jerry-buss-20130219-story.html).

When West abruptly left the organization after the 2000 championship, he said his body could no longer take the stress.

‚ÄúEverything around here has taken its toll,‚Äù he told me at the time. ‚ÄúYou see my outside, but you don‚Äôt see my inside, and it‚Äôs just awful in there. This compulsion with winning, it‚Äôs a sickness.‚Äù

But it was about more than winning, it was about how they were winning. Coach Phil Jackson was being given more power. He was also dating the owner‚Äôs daughter, giving Jackson more perceived stature. West was increasingly uncomfortable with dynamics that seemed to be marginalizing his presence.

When West talked of, ‚ÄúEverything around here ‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù much of that was centered on Jackson and Buss.

As the years passed, West became more bitter, and the Lakers became more resentful of his bitterness, and, once Jerry Buss died in 2013, West‚Äôs connections to the club were seemingly gone forever.

One of the final breaking points occurred in 2017, when Jeanie Buss cleared out the front office and hired Rob Pelinka and Magic Johnson to run the team. West had publicly said he would be interested in returning home to join them, but nothing was offered, and so he joined the Clippers.

In his introductory Clippers news conference, he took a veiled shot at the Lakers, saying,‚ÄúMy last stop along the way, \[I want\] to be associated with people who are really basketball people, people I have respect for and, more importantly, I think, an incredible owner.‚Äù

Four years later, the relationship was ruined forever when, on a podcast, [Jeanie Buss named her five most important Lakers ever](https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-04-24/jeanie-buss-top-5-lakers).

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Phil Jackson.

West, unarguably the most important Laker ever, wasn‚Äôt even on the list, and he was furious. He was so insulted, he told one media organization that he sometimes wished he had never even played with the Lakers.

‚ÄúOne disappointing thing \[about my career\] is that my relationship with the Lakers is horrible,‚Äù [West said in a 2022 interview with The Athletic](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3095914/2022/02/01/nba-75-at-no-14-jerry-west-was-mr-clutch-and-forever-will-be-brutally-honest-about-himself/). ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know why. And at the end of the day, when I look back, I say, ‚ÄòWell, maybe I should have played somewhere else instead of with the Lakers, where someone would have at least appreciated how much you give, how much you cared.‚Äô‚Äù

To all this animosity, add the fact that in 2019, the Lakers parted ways with West‚Äôs son Ryan, who was their director of player personnel. Then there was Jerry West‚Äôs claim that the Lakers took away his season tickets, further annoying him.

Amid Wednesday‚Äòs gloom, it was inspirational to see how the Clippers supported Jerry West, with lengthy tributes not only from Ballmer, but also team president Lawrence Frank and Coach Tyronn Lue.

But it was equally sad to see how detached West appeared from the organization he built.

The Lakers still have room on their jerseys for a patch, right? Next year they should wear a JW in his honor.

The Lakers have never dedicated their hardwood, right? Next year they could name it, ‚ÄúJerry West Court.‚Äù

The greatest Laker is gone, but his legacy must not be forgotten.

Especially by the Lakers."
145,"[Buha] Similar to the Thompson sign-and-trade discussions, one of the current hold-ups in a potential DeRozan deal is what the Bulls would be receiving from the Lakers. (‚Ä¶) They have been active in recent days, discussing potential deals with Portland, Brooklyn and Utah, among other teams. ","More from Buha:

> After missing out on Thompson, the Lakers quickly turned their attention to another James target: free-agent wing DeMar DeRozan. 

> Similar to Thompson, DeRozan, 34, is both a potential non-taxpayer midlevel exception candidate and a sign-and-trade candidate for Los Angeles, according to league sources. He is another player whom James would be willing to take less for, league sources confirmed and ESPN first reported.

> They have been active in recent days, discussing potential deals with Portland, Brooklyn and Utah, among other teams, according to league and team sources. 

> Vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka tends to operate in the shadows ‚Äî more so this summer than ever, according to league sources. It‚Äôs certainly possible he has a contingency plan that saves the offseason.

> James re-signing for the max seems to be the most likely outcome as of Tuesday morning. "
146,[Irwin] P1: DFS to Lakers has a chance | P2: LeBron wants Ham out and getting tired with ownership | P3: Pelinka & Ham making roster decisions and how Woj gets to break it,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=av6ZiCpdDp4

**Trades:**

>Atlanta‚Äôs ownership got involved and have been adamant that there‚Äôs no Dejounte Murray deal without Austin Reaves and may prefer to hold onto Murray til the summer.

>It‚Äôs a stalemate between Lakers and Hawks, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only so many times Lakers can have the exact same conversation with Atlanta.‚Äù

>Lakers don‚Äôt want to just move D‚ÄôAngelo without getting a starting PG back in return.

>‚ÄúDFS for Vincent and picks - that‚Äôs the trade I heard, today, that makes the most sense‚Äù. Lakers have a better chance pursuing DFS if Brooklyn is okay with taking Gabe Vincent as part of the trade.

**LeBron:**

>LeBron has a breaking point and it‚Äôs getting to that point with ownership and the front office. 

>Started when Lakers failed to hire Ty Lue. 

>Second time was Pelinka leaking to outlets that it was LeBron and AD‚Äôs idea to trade for Westbrook, when Pelinka was actually all-in as well. (Note: Magic also noted he quit because he was tired of Pelinka‚Äôs backstabbing)

>Third time was when LeBron explicitly asked the Lakers to trade Westbrook during the summer. But management did not, instead hired a coach for Westbrook, only to wait til the the deadline to trade Westbrook anyway. LeBron was happy with the trade that he was excited to run it back last summer with the new guys‚Ä¶ but unfortunately Darvin Ham didn‚Äôt get the memo. ([earlier podcast detailed here:]( https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1agegup/irwin_the_amount_of_trust_and_confidence_rob/))

>Fourth time is when LeBron made it known within that Ham isn‚Äôt working out, and Lakers should get someone else. But Pelinka then immediately leaked to everybody that Lakers are not firing Ham.

>Irwin believes not firing Ham could be the one time too many that LeBron has had enough with Lakers ownership. ‚ÄúLeBron wants to retire a Laker but he also doesn‚Äôt want to be taken advantage off.‚Äù

**Woj:**

>Irwin explains how any Laker trades are kept secret and is usually broken by Woj. 

>The way Pelinka does business ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told‚Äù he gathers all information and locks himself in a room at times with Darvin Ham, and they make their roster decisions together. In this case, there are only a handful of reporters Pelinka talks to directly and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always almost just Woj/Shams that break them, but mostly just Woj because Pelinka has been a guess in a lot of his podcast shows."
147,My Head Coach Candidates Thoughts ,"Hello fellow Lakers fans, I‚Äôm new to the subreddit, but I‚Äôve been a Laker fan for years now and wanted to give my input on the Head Coaching search. **There is no specific order of Candidates**, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there‚Äôs a perfect or worst possible option for the Lakers. For this specific post, this is based off the most popular reported and fan favorite Candiates. 

I would appreciate any thoughts or feedback you guys have if any, as long as it‚Äôs constructive and meaningful, go for it. For each candidate, I‚Äôll provide a short description and reasoning to prevent this from becoming a novel.¬†This is written in the third person view, but I‚Äôd have no problem sharing my actual opinion. 

**David Adelman (Denver Nuggets)**

Adelman, who is currently Denver‚Äôs lead assistant under Head Coach Michael Malone, was a key part along with other members on the coaching staff in winning the Nugget‚Äôs first championship in franchise history. Adelman is highly respected and often praised by his players, but also would bring in high knowledge of implementing an offensive system into L.A, but it would depend on who he brings to the Lakers as part of his coaching staff, preferably someone who specializes on the defensive end of the ball. As a young and rising Head Coach candidate, Adelman has been featured and interviewed in several vacant head coaching jobs these past couple of seasons.

Adelman previously has made stops in Minnesota (2011-2015) and Orlando (2016-2017) under former Lakers Head Coach Frank Vogel. On top of being a player development coach, he also brings in experience as a top assistant on a championship team who can possibly go back-to-back in this year‚Äôs playoffs.¬†

Although this would be his first head coaching job, Adelman has been in situations where he‚Äôs been the acting head coach in the absence of Michael Malone, meaning he‚Äôs no stranger in calling the shots.¬†

**Micah Nori (Minnesota Timberwolves)**¬†

Nori, currently serving as Minnesota Timberwolves‚Äôs lead assistant is known for his defensive philosophies which can be very important for the Lakers, before joining Minnesota, he made stops in Toronto (2009-2013), Sacramento (2013-2015) under current Nuggets Head Coach Michael Malone, and Detroit. Nori is highly respected as a coach and leader in the NBA, but with a reputation as one of the league‚Äôs best defensive coaches? It‚Äôs no surprise he‚Äôs a hot name in coaching searches such as the Lakers job.

Nori is also known for his well detailed and efficient breakdowns of the team's defensive schemes often streamed on the Timberwolves broadcasts. Obviously Nori can make a huge impact on the defense and he was Detroit's offensive coordinator under Dwane Casey, it would be wise to have an experienced offensive mind on his coaching staff.¬†

**David Joerger (Milwaukee Bucks)**

Joerger is currently a top assistant for Doc Rivers in Milwaukee who was previously hired earlier this season, but has had stops as a Head Coach in Memphis (2013-2016) and Sacramento (2016-2019). Known for his ‚ÄúGrit and Grind‚Äù style of coaching, it may come in handy for this Lakers team, along with his experience of player development, the younger guys on the team would still be able to thrive in his system.¬†

Joerger hasn‚Äôt been a hot name in Head coaching searches, but he can be a great service to Lakers with cleaning up both sides of the ball. Before reuniting with Doc Rivers in Milwaukee, Joerger had been serving as a Coaching Consultant in Cleveland for Head Coach JB Bickerstaff.¬†¬†

**Mike Budenholzer**

Budenholzer is known for being the Head Coach of the Atlanta Hawks (2013-2018) and the Milwaukee Bucks (2018-2023), who he won a championship with in the 2021-2022 season. After being fired by the Bucks in 2023 after an early exit in the playoffs, Budenholzer remains to be a hot name in the coaching searches, however financial and job security seems to be more important than ever for the experienced Head Coach. According to Brooklyn Nets sources, Budenholzer wanted a coaching deal that was worth eight million or more per year which clearly wasn‚Äôt going to be considered as Jordi Fernandez shortly was named the Head Coach.¬†

Despite his price tag, Budenholzer would be able to assemble an experienced coaching staff, implement a defensive system, and take the helm of the head coach position. If Budenholzer was chosen to be the Head Coach, he would be without his two top assistants he previously worked with in Milwaukee; Darvin Ham (for obvious reasons) and possibly Charles Lee Jr. (Current Lead assistant for the Celtics).¬†

The Lakers organization would prefer a championship pedigree coach, but is it worth the extreme cost and possible continuation of Darvin Ham?¬†

**Terry Stotts**

Stotts is known for his time as Portland‚Äôs Head Coach (2012-2021) and for his offensive philosophies, leading Portland to the playoffs in 8 out of his 9 seasons. Although Portland had trouble making it out of the first round on several occasions, he had always been respected by his players (notably Damian Lillard) and the Portland organization. Stotts was also a key member of Rick Carlisle‚Äôs coaching staff during the Mavericks championship season (2010-2011).¬†

It‚Äôs no question that Stotts‚Äôs offensive system can be applied to the current roster, but his defensive schemes are nowhere near to be found, however that‚Äôs the reason why most of his assistants were more defensive minded. Some of his defensive assistants are still in the league today notably; David Vanterpool, who was recently retained on the Wizard‚Äôs coaching staff and Dale Osborne, a current Orlando Magic assistant coach, so it may be possible to poach them away if necessary.¬†

During the Lakers coaching search in 2022, Stotts had made it clear he would not be an assistant coach to another head coach (with the exception of Milwaukee as he was a team hire due to their history and not Adrian Griffin‚Äôs), so him becoming a lead assistant to other head coaching candidates would not be in the cards.¬†

**Scott Brooks**

Brooks, who recently served as Portland‚Äôs Lead assistant under Chauncey Billups, has also served as the Head Coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder (2008-2015) and the Washington Wizards (2016-2021). Although Scott Brooks has never won a championship as a Head Coach, his leadership led the majority of his teams to the playoffs, but never was able to finish the job.¬†

Scott Brooks is known for his offensive philosophy, but the Lakers have struggled with their defense these past couple of seasons. There‚Äôs little doubt that Scott Brooks can lead the team to the playoffs, but can he provide different results than his predecessor?

**Charles Lee (Boston Celtics)**

Lee, who is currently serving as Boston‚Äôs associate head coach and a key part of their defense is another young and rising Head Coach candidate who also served as Milwaukee‚Äôs associate head coach after the departure of Darvin Ham. At the age 39, Lee has been a key candidate for several head coaching jobs, including the Lakers job in 2022.¬†

Lee was under Mike Budenholzer‚Äòs wing during their time in Atlanta and Milwaukee, using his knowledge and skills into Boston‚Äôs current systems, however he has never held a head coaching position, which could be similar to Darvin Ham‚Äôs (his fellow assistant during those two stops) learning experiences. Learning the ropes on becoming a head coach at a younger age than some in the NBA could be beneficial for Lee, but how much more time will the Lakers have to sacrifice to accommodate another rookie head coach?¬†

**Kenny Atkinson (Golden State Warriors)**

Atkinson is currently the Top Assistant for the Golden State Warriors, a promotion he earned after Mike Brown departed the team for the Sacramento Kings head coaching job in 2022, but he is mostly known for his time as the Brooklyn Nets Head Coach (2016-2020). Atkinson favors the offensive side of the ball and player development, so he isn‚Äôt the most unique candidate on this list, however due to his ‚Äútense‚Äù relationship with D‚ÄôAngelo Russell (who is still questionable to return to the team, pending player option and/or free agency), it may not be the most ideal partnership with the former Nets coach. Even if D‚ÄôLo doesn‚Äôt return, his offensive system can definitely pay off.¬†

Atkinson has been a name circling around coaching searches, but is he the most ideal candidate out of all possible options in this search? It‚Äôs very much possible due to his player development experience that he will be a potential candidate for the Washington Wizards job which could be a better fit for him than the Lakers.¬†

**Conclusion**¬†

We all must remember that it‚Äôs not only the Head Coach‚Äòs responsibility to manage a team, this summer General Manager Rob Pelinka must continue to fulfill his end of the deal and construct another roster that can hopefully do a better job of complimenting LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Especially when Davis‚Äôs time to be passed down the torch can be coming sooner than we think.¬†

As I mentioned in the beginning of my post, if anyone has any thoughts they‚Äôd like to share about the list, I‚Äôd love to hear them. Based on prior posts and comments, there‚Äôs different opinions (good and bad) on each candidate, but that‚Äôs part of the game and being a fan, we‚Äôre just here to share our own opinions."
148,This sub needs to lay off AD. It‚Äôs not his fault our two starting guards are total traffic cones on defense and AD single-handedly has to cover that.,"It‚Äôs really evident how 80% of this sub doesn‚Äôt understand the game of basketball and shits on AD whenever Sabonis or any other center gets a rebound over him.

Take today for an example, the Kings have 3-4 quick guards and D-Lo / AR cannot stay in front of them. It takes one dribble for Fox / Monk to blow by our guards, and AD in turn has to come off Sabonis and help. AD is elite at altering shots and if there is a miss, AD is obviously out of position as he‚Äòs off Sabonis leaving him free. Once AR/D-Lo see AD coming to help, it is their job to try and get a body in front of Sabonis but they stand and watch. Then the sub proceeds shits on AD. I‚Äôm sorry but he cannot cover for our terrible guard defense and then also teleport back 4 feet to box out a center, and also throw up 35 a game.

We used to have the perfect players and now we have solely one dimensional players outside of Bron and AD. Caruso was a lockdown defender, Danny Green was a plus defender at the guard position and elite team defender, and KCP was a plus defender as well. AR / D-Lo while certainly bringing positives on offense are a HUGE net negative on defense, and continue to get exposed against teams with young and athletic guards.

It‚Äôs so sad because we had the blueprint and Rob Pelinka got cute and ruined it. AD has openly stated he prefers playing the 4 and we continue to force him to play C. He‚Äôs never been a bruiser and never will be. Super physical centers do often get AD out of his element and we have been knowing this, and yet we continue to force him to play out of position. He rarely played 5 on the Pelicans. In 2020, We used to have Dwight and Javale, and in 2021 we had Marc Gasol. Anyone ever rewatch some tape from our 2020 Nuggets series? Dwight was a MAJOR factor as he was a bruiser that frustrated Jokic. Javale and Dwight that series combined averaged close to 30 mpg which allowed AD to be fresh when he played the 5.

This sub continues to shit on AD who‚Äôs a once in a generation type player and was instrumental in bringing #17 and its starting to become pathetic. Have D-Lo and AR been amazing on offense, absolutely, but it‚Äôs bullshit to totally not even mention their massive flaws on defense and blame AD for it.

Come playoff time, this team will not be able to win if AR and D-Lo get major time together on the court. Ironically enough, look at the Bucks. They traded Jrue for Dame and their D is now absolutely shit. Giannis now has to take on the role of rim protector and while he‚Äôs certainly elite, I bet he wishes he could have Jrue back."
149,"[Woike] If I were a Laker fan, the place that I would look where the Lakers might be able to make a move without completely denting what they currently have on the roster, would be the Utah Jazz.","- The reason I say the Utah Jazz is because they own something from the Lakers. They own the Lakers‚Äô pick 5-30 in the 2027 NBA draft. There is value in engaging with Utah and introducing unprotecting that pick. That does not mean trading for Lauri Markannen but it does mean they can be a potential third team in deals. They are also a team that has some players that the Lakers have been linked to at times like say Collin Sexton. 

- At the end of the day I still think if this team is going to do something it will be more major than minor. It will be something bigger for a starting level player, because otherwise you are just muddying up your bench and taking minutes from young players you are looking to develop.


**What type of players are the Lakers interested in?**

- We know that the team would like a big. Anthony Davis and LeBron James think that getting a big like Jonas Valanciunas would matter. That would be an archetype to get traded is a depth piece in the frontcourt.

- Two-way players. They still need two-way players. Two way guards two way wings, but the demand for those is high.

- They would have signed Spencer Dinwiddie if they traded D‚ÄôAngelo Russell.



**Is there a limit to Jeanie Buss‚Äô patience with Rob Pelinka?**

- I think yes. I don‚Äôt exactly know where that limit is. I know Jeanie wants to win. When you talk to Jeanie about her job she mentions he father a lot and she mentions titles. The team has had a pretty stable lineage of execs and front office people and I think there is a lot of loyalty to Rob Pelinka for a lot of reasons. And he won a title. I don‚Äôt know what level of credit he deserves for this but he reinvigorated the franchise. Signed LeBron. Brought in AD.

- As far as the patience moving forward I think it‚Äôs being tested. These next handful of decisions are very important. I think that‚Äôs why you see Pelinka take a lot of ownership of the recent coaching and player personnel decisions. Making it clear that these are my decisions. I think that‚Äôs because his fate is at stake.


**Other notes‚Ä¶**

- Jalen Hood-Schfino is doing well. He was practicing with the summer league team and based on what I heard in Vegas I would be surprised if he‚Äôs not ready by training camp.

- The Lakers have a very thin front office with no college or league-wide scouting department. They are not as plugged on some of this stuff around the margins. I spend some time pregame with a lot of teams before games scouting shootaround, gathering intel. The Lakers don‚Äôt do that."
150,"[Haynes] Sources: Lakers Committed to Darvin Ham, Focused on Improving Backcourt","> Having lost 11 of their past 16 contests and on the heels of an 18-point loss at home to the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night, the Los Angeles Lakers remain committed to head coach Darvin Ham, league sources tell Bleacher Report.

> Owner Jeanie Buss and president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka have informed the second-year head coach that his job is not in jeopardy, sources say.

> With the Feb. 8 trade deadline approaching, the Lakers are seeking speed and quickness in the backcourt, sources say. The Lakers want to push the pace offensively and are interested in someone who can serve as a point-of-attack defender.

> Rival executives believe the Lakers and Toronto Raptors‚Äîamong other teams‚Äîwill begin progressing to more serious discourse with the Atlanta Hawks pertaining to star guard Dejounte Murray, sources say.

> But it remains to be seen if the Lakers have enough attractive assets to entice Atlanta. Atlanta is not operating as if Murray has to be dealt by the deadline. They have made it known in league circles that they're more than comfortable keeping him in the fold and revisiting his future in the offseason.

151,LA Talking Trades With At Least 3 Rival Clubs,"""It‚Äôs too early to write the Lakers off, of course. There‚Äôs always a chance they pull a rabbit out of a hat with a trade or signing. They have been active in recent days, discussing potential deals with Portland, Brooklyn¬†and Utah, among other teams, according to league and team sources. Vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka tends to operate in the shadows ‚Äî more so this summer than ever, according to league sources. It‚Äôs certainly possible he has a contingency plan that saves the offseason."""

153,"Wasting Draft Selection #17 in a Win-Now Window is Disrespectful to Bron and AD, As Well as Pure Incompetence","I wish this sub and the Lakers fanbase were able to have more objective discussions regarding our team. I don‚Äôt understand how Jeanie, the Front Office, our Scouting Department, and even Rob Pelinka (though not as much) get shielded from fair blame and criticism as much as they do. 

We still have people blaming Bron and AD for WestBrick who don‚Äôt realize that final judgment comes down to the President of Basketball Operations/GM (Rob Pelinka). Mind you, the front office was more than happy to say NO to Bron when it came to Ty Lue, Jared Dudley, Demar Derozan, and so many more things he asked for yet didn‚Äôt get.

I just don‚Äôt understand why such a large portion of this fanbase is able to be so critical of our stars who carry us (Bron and AD) for the smallest things, yet protect Jeanie and the front office from any and all criticisms. The reality is Jeanie leads a front office group who is cheap (given our status as the premier franchise, we should be perennial top 3 luxury tax spenders), nepotistic, and flat out INCOMPETENT. The front office‚Äôs incompetence and malpractice has dismantled the ceiling of our team. 

If all we end up with from the Bron and AD era is 1 Ring and 1 NBA Cup, I personally will give them all the credit and also blame our front office for hindering Bron/AD from achieving even more.

I didn‚Äôt like the JHS selection on draft night, and said as much, only to be met with front office apologists: https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/14glygg/thoughts_from_those_who_advocated_for_keeping_the/?rdt=42990"

155,Daily Lakers Offseason Discussion Thread,The Lakers offseason is underway. Talk about whatever you want.
156,"[Amick] According to a Pelicans source, those talks were never seen as serious from their side. New Orleans believes it was largely used as leverage (that didn‚Äôt work) against the Lakers.","> This much is clear: Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka didn‚Äôt see the Hawks‚Äô Dejounte Murray as the kind of difference-maker who would vault his team back into a title contender. If he did, he would‚Äôve put Austin Reaves into the offer like Atlanta had wanted and done the deal."
157,"If the plan is Klay (S&T) and Derozan (NTMLE), how do we build the rest of the roster out?","Based on the current known information, it seems that the focus for LAL is Klay and Derozan. Both known names but are closer to the end of their careers than the beginning.

Let‚Äôs assume we land both of these guy - how would you build out the rest of the roster? I feel like we have significant defensive gaps (athletic guard defender, two way wing, and inside rim protector) w/ a lot of offense"

159,"[Woike] The Lakers are planning to offer their head coaching position to UConn coach Dan Hurley, according to people with knowledge of the team‚Äôs plans but not authorized to speak publicly.","Talks will increase in the coming days and this news even shocked top officials in the Lakers organization.

160,How does this sub feel about the Lakers right now? Darvin Ham? Pelinka?,"TLDR (MY THOUGHTS): I think if we can get healthy, and add a TRUE 3&D AND/OR a starting caliber big to pair with AD, that can defend and crash the class well, then we should be in a good spot. I‚Äôd be willing to give Ham the season to see what we got.

As it stands we‚Äôre almost at the quarter mark of the season (time flies right?). Lakers are 11-8, 7th in the West, 3 GB of 1st. They‚Äôre also in the knockout stages of the in season tournament, after going undefeated in the Group Stage.

This team is hard to read on. Very inconsistent so far but a lot to be desired. Big issues so far involve rebounding, shooting, and perimeter defense. 

We aren‚Äôt fully healthy, so granted I do think when we‚Äôre at full strength, it‚Äôll help with those deficiencies. But even then I think this team needs 1-2 pieces to fully contend. 

Darvin Ham is also hard to read on. He‚Äôs frustrating in a lot of aspects, but consider what he‚Äôs done so far. Lakers had a 47 million dollar liability that hampered the team, and when traded for spare parts, this team went 17-6 to close out the year. And made the WCF. And while we got swept, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a one legged Bron and AD to carry against the Nuggets. Especially when we had Tristan Thompson on Jokic. So I‚Äôm willing to be patient with him. But he has to improve on rotations, because so help me god if I see Rui get garbage time minutes when he gets back, I‚Äôm gonna lose it.

Pelinka has won me over a bit after that trade deadline and this offseason. If I‚Äôm being honest, in the Lebron led era, I feel like he‚Äôs only missed when it came to the 2021 offseason. 2019 offseason he built us a championship core with key vet min guys. 2020 he traded DG for Schroder and tweaked the lineup, and it worked very well until injuries piled up. Even last years offseason was solid IMO. 

So I do believe whatever holes we have, he can address at the deadline. Also hope that he can net us one of the two pieces that I believe we need. I‚Äôll take either a Myles Turner type or a Alex Caruso type. Idk who, and idk how, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not GM. He is lmao.

All in all. Too early to tell. Let‚Äôs get healthy and see where it goes from there."

163,Start placing your bets,
164,Do you think Rob will be our GM this off-season or do you want him to be? ,"He‚Äôs made a lot of mistakes and if you want to argue it was LeGm than that‚Äôs up to you but at the end of the day he‚Äôs our GM.Final straw has to be this Ham hire. He‚Äôs made some good decisions too but a majority of those were correcting bad ones. 

I don‚Äôt want to make this post for people to argue about my opinion I want to hear what the fan base has to say but I‚Äôll be the first to leave my ‚Äúhot take‚Äù opinion. I think we should fire Rob and let our new GM fire Ham and find us a coach with a brain then retool the roster.

This might be the most important off-season of the last decade for us, can we really trust Pelinka? Let me know "
165,Will Always H8 Us Cuz They Ain‚Äôt Us‚Ä¶,"
1979 - See even Jerry Tarkanian doesn‚Äôt want to take the Lakers job. UNLV is a better job.

1980 - Lakers beat 76ers for the chip.

1981 - Magic wants to be traded?  Doesn‚Äôt want to play for Westhead? Westhead just won us the championship. Why ruin a good thing? Pat Riley just got here.

1982 - Chip

1985 - Chip

1987 - Chip

1988 - Chip  

1996 - We wasted our pick on this 18-year old kid? 4 air balls??? Who names their kid Kobe?

1996 - Why would Shaq go to the Lakers? They‚Äôre 4th in the West.

2004 - We traded Shaq instead of Kobe? We‚Äôre so screwed.  See even Mike Krzyzewski declined to coach the Lakers - Lakers are worse than the Clippers.

2005 - Phil Jackson returns to the Lakers.

2006 - See Shaq just won with Miami. Jerry Buss is an idiot.  Nobody wants to play with Kobe.

2008 - Lakers acquire Pau and just had to give up Kwami Brown???  The NBA is rigged for the Lakers!  The rich get richer!

2009 - Chip

2010 - Chip

2011 - NBA vetos Chris Paul trade.  About time - they robbed the NBA with the Pau trade.

2013 - Why would the Lakers extend Kobe for all that money (Pelinka Kobe‚Äôs agent). They need to build this roster.  Nobody wants to play with Kobe.

2018 - Why would Lebron go the Lakers, they‚Äôre a dumpster fire and have no team.  Lebron just cares about Hollywood not basketball - he‚Äôs won his championships.

2019 - Lakers gave up how much for AD??? The Pelicans are going to win a chip before we do.  Rob Pelinka‚Äôs should have left with Magic.

2019 - How did the Lakers mess up on acquiring Ty Lue?

2020 - Chip

Today - How did we lose out on Klay like we lost Kyrie?  Pelinka‚Äôs a bum.  Jeanie is not her dad.  JJ Redick, really???  We wasted a (almost never valuable) 2nd pick on Bronny James?

If it was easy everyone would have championships‚Ä¶ Lakers versus everyone (always has been).
