3,The story about Will Hardy ja GM Justin Zanik with Team Finland [via google translate],
4,The point of this season is not to win a championship,"I've rooted for the Jazz my entire life. I always want them to win. In my lifetime, I've been fortunate enough to see two teams that could have won a championship if they had been extremely lucky (2007 and 2021) and been unfortunate enough to see them come up frustratingly short. I watch basketball, and I know when a team is good enough to win a championship if everything goes right; there are usually 5-6 (sometimes only one or two). This team is not one of them.

And Danny Ainge knows this! Justin Zanik knows this! Ryan Smith knows this! Will Hardy knows this! As much as I want this team to win, and will absolutely invest myself in winning in the big picture, this season is not meant to be one where we win a championship. We should be rooting for our young guys to develop properly, and for a clear path forward where we can acquire or develop a true stud who can lead us to a ring. Yeah, root for individual games and players, but getting your panties in a twist because we lost a game to the Magic because of turnovers is missing the point of the season."
