1,Still undefeated in the trade market. Kevin Pritchard does not lose 🥱,
2,Updated with technicality: Kevin Pritchard’s key to NBA Domination,Thank god for Kira Lewis being on the Pacers for like 5 minutes to facilitate the Siakam trade
3,Can we please give it up for Kevin Pritchard,This man have brought life back into Indiana basketball. It hasn't been THIS fun since the early to mid 2010s!
4,New Pacers forward Pascal Siakam just got off a phone call with coach Rick Carlisle and president Kevin Pritchard. Siakam maintains his Bird Right’s with Pacers who are expected to re-sign him in free agency. Appears doubtful Siakam will debut for Pacers tomorrow at Sacramento.,
5,Should Pritchard have been higher or nah?  I feel like the Pascal trade should have gotten more credit on this list ,
6,Keep the team the same.,"If Mathurin becomes what he is capable of next year and Haliburton’s hamstring heals and he returns closer to pre-injury form (25-12 on 52-44-88 shooting), plus Siakam for a full year, they have a shot at being the best team in basketball."
7,Great trade Chad,
8,Haliburton: The next Sheriff?,"A month or so ago, everyone was hating on me for comparing Tyrese to Peyton. Vindicated! Even the Houston beat writers can see it lol!"
9,Believe we need a trade yet?!,"How can anyone watch that and think we don't need to make a trade?! Forget chemistry, we don't have the parts! We NEED a wing stopper. I'm sick of Tatum cooking us just bc he's tall. Like seriously Kevin Pritchard, make a fucking move. I'm so god damn over watching Buddy Hield have these worthless shooting nights compounded by getting run over and targeted by any talented wing on the other team. Nesmith was bad tonight, but you at least get elite defense with him. Myles was next to invisible and shrank in the moment while we are on the subject of people being bad. Now that we are off this 6 game win streak, I hope people can have some freaking objectivity and see that this team still needs parts. I love our guys too, but the goal is always a title. I'm not happy just having likeable players even though they can't get the job done.

Fix this roster!

Edit: I may have gotten carried away. I was hot after the game. I stand on bidness about needing a wing stopper though. I hope we get Kuminga. He and Jarace could be a crazy 3/4 defensive tandem playing in front of Turner 💀 I would be so happy.

P.s. please stop downvoting me"
10,[Windy] Team USA's Haliburton ready to take Pacers into prime time,
11,"The Uncanny History of City Edition Jersey Designer, Renick Bowman","Growing up in Rural Indiana, Renick was the youngest of 4 with a loving Mother and Father who provided their children with what they described as a ""simple"" life. However upon Renick's arrival, things got a little strange in the Bowman household.

His mother described Renick as a charming and energetic young boy who got along with everyone and was, by all accounts, a normal boy. But there seemed to be a weird energy that surrounded him. Once his family noticed crows perched on top of the house, and as time went on more and more crows would swarm the house, slamming into Renicks bedroom window. Another time, Renick was heard speaking what was described as ""Latin"" in his sleep, which was oddly peculiar since no one in the house spoke Latin nor did Renick study Latin during his classes. It wasn't until Renick removed his shirt one day only for his parents to see a strange marking on his back. Startled, they asked where he had received a tattoo. Renick, unaware of the markings on his back, was confused by his parents' reaction. Being devoted children of God, his parents were alarmed and thought that there was only one explanation and feared the worst. Being in a small town, word got around quick and when a local Deacon caught word of Renick, he contacted the family and informed them that their son had the Mark of the Beast, confirming their speculation that Renick was being followed by spirits. The deacon offered to reform Renick and brought him to a local church where an exorcism was to be performed. 

Unbeknownst to Renick's parents, this was no Deacon, Renick was known in the possession of The Grand Warlock of the Salem Covenant. He sensed Renicks connection to the Dark Arts and saw him as the perfect protégé for his inevitable retirement from the covenant. Once the ""exorcism"" was complete the Warlock informed his parents that Renick would be fine but that he should continue to see the boy to ensure the spirits do not revisit him.

After studying under the Warlock for a few years, Renick rose up quickly in the ranks of the covenant and ultimately became the youngest Grand Warlock since the inception of the Covenant. During his time as a warlock, Renick never harmed any people or animals, he only practiced the Dark Arts from a theoretical standpoint and eventually stepped away from the covenant as he entered adulthood, stating that ""I started to realize how evil and creepy it was and wanted to move on.""

Renick transitioned back into normalcy and found his passion in design. Since then, he's worked on many projects and is regarded as a brilliant designer. In 2023, the Indiana Pacers Front Office approached Renick with an offer to design their City Edition Jerseys. Renick, in complete shock, was humbled and befuddled as to why they would approach him. He had never worked on basketball apparel and has never expressed interest in designing for a sports team. According to Renick, ""Kevin Pritchard called me out of the blue and said,'You're our guy, and we have an offer you can't refuse'. I was like, why me? I've never designed jerseys. KP said we trust, and he went on about how the Pacers were cursed by an Indigenous tribe after building over their bural grounds, and they've tried everything to shake it. They somehow knew of my Warlock background and saw me as someone who held the knowledge to break the curse.""

Renick accepted the offer and began working on what would be the current design of the pacers City Edition uniforms. During the initial pitch, Renick presented a white Jersey with gold paint splattered on the sides and teal trimmings. He then recited a spell that Renick describes as ""ideally forbidden"" and the Pacers staff watched in awe as the white Jerseys turned black. KP was recorded as frantically yelling "" That's it! That's what we need!! Yes!!""

Renick solemnly explained to Pacers FO that the hex casted on to the jerseys will not only supersede any curse or evil spirits that may be hindering the Pacers but that when wearing the jerseys the players will exhibit ""supernatural abilities"". He quickly warned KP that this type of sorcery comes at a hefty price. He explained that to channel this level of dark energy required a sacrifice, and that sacrifice was Pacers defense. No matter how hard they try, no matter the scheme or personnel, the 2023-24 Pacers will not be able to defend. KP and Rick reluctantly accepted the terms, and the City Edition Jerseys were born. 

The Pacers are currently undefeated when wearing the City Unis, and Adam Silver has not commented on the matter at this time."

18,Buchanan's Comments,"How much do we read into the GM's comments and omissions? 
*This is taken from an interview with Chad Buchanan  on Setting The Pace with Alex and Facci.

""we have the ability to retain a lot of our guys and the ability to bring this team back for the most part. And we like that. We like that option...We feel good about things moving forward with our young group and our ability to hopefully keep a couple of our guys and continue to try to build this team piece by piece.""

He basically said that he wants to run it back with the same lineup and re-sign Siakam and Toppin. He said nothing about Smith and McDermott, so I'm assuming he's moved on mentally.

Siakam:  ""Moving forward, if he’s with us, hopefully he is, that full training camp, full off-season with our guys and a full season only acclimates him and gets him more and more comfortable with our group. And I think he’s got some very, very good years ahead of him. People talk about his age, but I think his best years are still ahead of him.""

Toppin:  ""Surprising thing, I would say the catch and shoot really became consistent and steady. To the point where you were disappointed when you didn’t see him let it fly. When you feel like he had some space and he might shot fake and drive or he might just move it, you want to just kind of let it fly because you have so much confidence in his shooting. Another thing that surprised me a little bit with him was there were nights defensively where he really impacted the game. I think he took on the challenge some certain matchups, certain nights where we really needed it...And like I said, hope he’s with us moving forward.""

Jackson:  ""You look at Dallas. Dallas has two centers that are very similar, a little bigger than Isaiah, but they’re rim rollers, they’re lob threats, they crash the glass, they take good shots, they’re great screeners, they have a very defined, simple role. And I think Isaiah can do those things very well.""

Johnson:  ""But our veterans did a good job of staying even keel, not getting too high about a win, not getting too down about a loss. And when he did lose, there was somebody that spoke up almost every game in the locker room. And those veterans, Pascal’s got a ring on his finger. He’s been through series like this and our guys really leaned on him. He could feel them looking for leadership. Some nights it was Ty, some nights it was Myles, TJ McConnell. Obviously, James Johnson is obviously speaking.""

McDermott: zilch

Smith: zilch

Nesmith:  ""During the draft, we loved his shooting. He was a movement shooter who could run off screens and get hot and score the ball. As he got into our system after the trade, we saw there was kind of a different side to him. He was a tough-minded, rugged defender. He’s more athletic than you realize. Just a guy whose energy and effort every night, every day was so consistent and so steady.""

Mathurin:  He highly praised Mathurin and his competitiveness. ""He likes to have a fire lit under him. Sometimes maybe he might twist words that are said about him a little bit, because it helps drive him. I love that. Kobe used to do that. MJ used to do that...There’s nights where you just need a guy that’s just going to blow his way to the rim and get a foul and get a bucket...He could be a terrific defender, I mean, phenomenal defender if he really commits to it...He’s one of the most competitive guys we have on the team and he wants to be great.""

Sheppard:  ""I think you’ll see as he gets older and more mature, he’ll add more stuff. He’ll be able to do more things off the dribble. You’ll see him get a little stronger, a little more physical. And his intelligence on the defensive end will only grow more and more as he gets more experienced because his effort is always there...He and Aaron, those guys just play so hard defensively. And there’s certain matchups that they don’t have the size or maybe the length or whatever it might be, but the effort is always going to be there.""

Walker:  He likes Walker at Small Forward. ""He had such a good year scoring the ball for us in the G League, and that’s good, but we want him to be that kind of utility guy who can do a little bit of everything. And we really need the defensive side, we need that big bodied guy that can match up with some of these 6’7”, 6’8”, 6’9” scoring wings that sometimes are a little big for Aaron, whereas Jarace has more of the size and the length and the body to handle that.""

McConnell:  ""Sure. Yeah, he’s eligible for an extension. He’s a guy that as you look at his age, his contribution, where his career is going, his production level is going, you don’t see a real drop-off from him yet. He’s been such a huge fiber of who we are; it would be hard to imagine your team without him. Now, this business has no guarantees. You can’t guarantee that he’s going to be here for the rest of his career, but you just know who he is and what he’s about...You’d hate to lose him. I know he’s happy here, he enjoys Indiana, he’s valued here. Moving him forward there’s no guarantees with anything, obviously, but he is a guy that I can guarantee you we really value and love having on our team, and we would look a lot different moving forward if he wasn’t with us.""

Haliburton:  ""I knew Tyrese was a terrific lead guard and creative player. And when your best player is a pass-first guy, you have a chance to be a really good offensive team.""

Nembhard:  He praised everyone, but had this  to say about Nembhard that makes me think he would trade him for the right player, which would open up SG for Math. ""For us to not have Andrew on the team, to move him it would have to be one heck of a player because we think the world of him and his versatility, his toughness. I think that really came out in the playoffs; his toughness really showed. He’s fearless. He’s quiet and he’s not a rah-rah guy, but he is a tough, tough dude. I love having him on the team. Whatever role it is, I just think he’s a big part of our group.""

Turner:  ""It’s like you kind of let a dog who’s in a cage, you let him out, let him run a little bit, let him kind of breathe a little bit and show what he can do...If you’re screening for Tyrese and you can shoot, you’re going to get a lot of open shots, and I think Myles understands that. Those two have developed a real chemistry, and as a five man who can spread the floor and shoot with the way we play with Pascal, TJ, and Bennedict when he’s out there, they’re attacking the rim. It just gives a lot of space to a lot of our other guys, and to see him have success this year after what he’s been through, and as loyal as he’s been to the Pacers and the organization when he really didn’t have to be and to see him get rewarded was really great to see. I know it meant a lot to him, because he’s wanted this for a long, long time, and to see it happen for him was really rewarding."" "

20,Great trade Chad,
21,I’m not a big Deadspin guy but credit to DJ Dunson of Deadspin…,"https://deadspin.com/james-johnson-giannis-antetokounmpo-indiana-pacers-nba-1851102287

Unsigned NBA wing James Johnson emerges from a cabin carrying a log. Meanwhile, on a television screen behind him, highlights of Giannis Antetokounpo hulking out on the sidelines and in the players tunnel repeats in a loop.

Johnson balances a wooden log upright and thrusts downward — with his bare hands. The log explodes in half. As he pauses to wipe his brow, the trees begin to sway and the repetitive whooping sound of helicopter choppers fills the air. 

The helicopter lands in a field. The door opens and out steps Pacers general manager Chad Buchanan guarding his bruised ribs.

“I know why you’re here,” Johnson says, interrupting Buchanan.

And with that the Pacers found their newest forward. Did Johnson’s signing play exactly like that? I’m not sure, but I’d like to imagine that’s how it played out…"
22,"[Fischer] The inclusion of Kira Lewis from New Orleans allowed Indiana to match Pascal Siakam’s salary without including another player besides Bruce Brown and Jordan Nwora. Pelicans had been looking to move Lewis dating back to this past offseason, sources said.","Instead of giving more players up to Toronto, KP said, “why don’t you guys take on a salary dump instead and I get an extra 2nd round pick this year”. Truly a pritch-slap worthy performance"
23,The Front office & THE TRADE,"It's been talked about all week, win-win vs who got the better end. This post isn't about the debate. This post is to honor KP and Chad Buchanan on turning Sabonis into the future of the NBA and a historic 3pt shooter. We got more than we gave and ultimately it was the final trade of a whole 7 year sage of trades.

We went from the Paul George disaster to Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Held and assets. No matter what anyone outside Indiana says, the important thing is won the Paul George trade. I'm not saying OKC lost. I'm saying Paul George lost. He got exactly what he wanted and he still has the same amount of rings as we do. Our future is bright and it's thanks to the perseverance and dedication of our front office. It's a great time to be a Pacer fan and thank God for Tyrese Haliburton 💙💛"
