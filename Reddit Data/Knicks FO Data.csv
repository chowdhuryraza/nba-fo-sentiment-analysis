0,[KFS] Bobby Marks: ‚ÄúIf Leon Rose‚Ä¶says ‚ÄòHey we're gonna have you decline your option & offer you 3 for 100‚Äô I would seriously consider taking that‚Ä¶$100M guaranteed‚Ä¶I think he's priced right right now at 30‚Äù,"I know Randle is a polarizing player in Knicks fandom‚Ä¶but man, the discourse surrounding him is disgusting.

Saying Randle should settle for 3 yrs. $100 mil and be grateful is beyond disrespectful lmaooo. I‚Äôm sure Bobby Marks doesn‚Äôt focus on the Knicks that much, so I‚Äôll give him a pass‚Ä¶but this is a terrible takeüòÇ.

Thoughts?"
1,Who is one Role Player from the dark ages (Isaiah Era - Leon Rose Era) you actually doped yourself into believing was a good nba player?,"I‚Äôll start, Lance Thomas, thought he was capable of being a Robert Covington (Prime obviously) type of role player, really impactful and would have good value on the trade market, boy was I wrong lmao "
2,[Fred Katz] Knicks president Leon Rose has declined a request to hold an end-of-season media availability.  No high-ranking Knicks executive has spoken on the record to independent media since September 2021. Rose is yet to do a solo press conference since taking over Knicks in April 2020.,
3,"[The Strickland] Leon Rose was hired to bring in a star ‚Äî he ended up breaking a curse: What if the Knicks‚Äô long-awaited messiah wasn‚Äôt a player, but a president?",
4,Bored at work so pretended to be Leon Rose,"Picks are 2024 1st (Own) traded as a player on draft night, 2024 1st (DAL), 2025 1st (OWN), 2025 1st (MIL), 2026 1st swap, 2026 2nd (BRK), 2027 1st (Own). Of course I don‚Äôt want it to take 4-5 1sts to get the trade done but I would do it because I believe Mikal Bridges makes us into team that could beat absolutely anyone in a series. Imagine that big long starting lineup. 

I‚Äôm of the belief that you can‚Äôt just replace Randle for a superstar like Booker or Mitchell and expect our team to be much better than if we just kept Randle in the first place. A better superstar fit like Giannis is just not gonna happen, Lauri would cost too much cause Danny Ainge is a prick, and Paul George is entering the season aged 34. If we don‚Äôt use our picks they‚Äôre just gonna get traded down the line for shittier picks with protections. Why not overpay to instantly become a top tier contender no question. We can‚Äôt sacrifice fit for talent, that‚Äôs not what made this team great in the first place and you see across the league just adding talent over fit doesn‚Äôt work anymore."

14,Leon Rose 2nd Round Trade Tactics,"I don't think people realize what Leon Rose does in the 2nd round of the draft. I'm doing something research on his tendency of the second round and it's starting to make a lot sense. It seems like he generally has a target in the late first or mid to early second. He stocks up draft picks by continuing to trade back and even if he doesn't want a player in that current draft he uses the stockpile of 2nd rounders the Knicks always has accumulated to overwhelm a team to trade their 2nd round pick for multiple 2nd round futures because most teams don't value 2nd rounders.

 OKC does the same that's why we trade with them so often. OKC gave up the 5 2nds because they always will have surplus like the Knicks so they also will be able to draft their ""perfect"" team for.

 When you look at it, It's absolutely brilliant. That's why we get players like Deuce and IQ while OKC gets players like the center Jalin Williams or Aaron Wiggins. It's actually brilliant when you think about it.

Edit: spelling "

16,The curious case of Leon Rose plans for the future (Kat & Juu Juu).,"I'm not certain about the accuracy of the reports regarding the Knicks considering a trade for Karl-Anthony Towns. If these reports are accurate, does this imply that the Knicks will trade Julius Randle, understanding that he will not re-signed after his contract expires? Additionally, it's worth noting that Julius has parted ways with CAA, which might provide insight into his future.

Or, is this just speculation and the Knicks will continued with Julius, adding a third shot-creator or defensive two (Murray or Donovan)?"
17,Leon Rose appreciation post,"Watching the pistons last night reminded me that it feels so good to have a consistent, competitive team to root for after all those years of ugly basketball.

56,Summer 2024: Knicks last star acquisition opportunity? Will it happen? Do we even need it to happen?,"**UPDATE 6/25/2024:**

Well well well. Look who was correct about Bridges to the Knicks. And look at all you fools who said it wouldn't happen. Who screamed it would not happen in all caps. And upvoted that idiotic detritus. Go crawl back to your troll holes and say that you always knew it was going to happen this summer. Smh.

**ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 6/6/2024:**

As you should know by now, This summer represents basically the Knicks‚Äô last chance to add a star max salary guy with this roster, because the new CBA‚Äôs stricter salary cap rules go into effect in one year.

As Leon Rose showed us with the Donovan Mitchell negotiations several years ago, Rose will exercise restraint and not make a deal for the sake of making a deal, something we are lucky to finally have.

All of that is to say that while the Knicks will most likely try to make their big swing for the final big star this summer, they probably will not end up getting the right franchise altering player.

Certainly, if either Devin Booker or Giannis were available, the Knicks would happily sacrifice Bojan, Randle, and all of their future first round picks. Realistically, however, those guys are not going anywhere. That leaves us with a bunch of other less appealing options that are ultimately not worth sacrificing everything for. Embiid? Too injury prone. LeBron? Too old. Durant? Probably too old. Donovan Mitchell? Redundant with Brunson on the team. Paul George? Not talented enough and too old (Frankly, I‚Äôd rather go for DeRozan to be honest over PG. just look at their advanced stats compared to each other the last 3 years. DeMar is better and it‚Äôs not close).

All of this is to say it‚Äôs probably not worth getting hopes up for another star. Maybe that‚Äôs okay. This team dominated with everyone healthy in January. Brunson is a star and could be an MVP. So, maybe it‚Äôs not necessary for us to get another top 10-15 overall player. Maybe we should get someone who is a top 50 player who is young and can defend and shoot and complement Brunson‚Äôs squad.

Although he is not a superstar, maybe Mikal Bridges is someone they acquire without having to sacrifice Randle. Maybe a package composed of Bojan and a boat load of future picks is enough to entice Brooklyn to give up Bridges.

Consider A starting lineup of: PG - Brunson SG - Bridges SF - OG PF - Randle C - I-Hart

With a bench made of: PG: McBride SG: Donte F: Burks F: Hart C: Robinson

Or, let‚Äôs say Brooklyn requires both Bogey and Randle but fewer draft picks for Bridges. Maybe the Knicks do that too because it enables them to keep some of their future picks. This scenario would also result in a great starting Five:

PG: Brunson SG: Donte SF: Bridges PF: OG C: I-Hart

Bench: PG: McBride SG: Burks F: Hart C: Robinson

That is a very solid team.

As we have seen with the recent NBA parity, it seems like a crapshoot once you get to the conference semifinals. All you need to do is build a team strong enough to guarantee a spot in the conference semifinals, and from there anything can happen. Look at Miami last year. Dallas this year. This is to say that we just need to build a 50 win team and keep guys healthy in the playoffs. We finished 2nd this year. With this core, we can do this again for another 3-5 years."
57,Brief exchange on Knicks on The Ringer over/under podcast on Randle,"What do we think of this exchange? All 3 took the Over on the Knicks this year. Simmons took the Knicks Over last year and it obviously hit.


**House:** The town loves this team and they gotta figure out what happens with Julius Randle but they have tons of flexibility in terms of picks and Talent to land [a guy], if Toronto decides to be a seller I expect the Knicks to be all-in on this so they're a super over for me this year.

**Simmons:** Randle‚Äôs last five years 22 10 and 4, 1 second team all NBA, 1 3rd team all NBA and you only missed 33 games, there's a case he‚Äôs like the most underrated guy in the league, nobody's like ‚Äúyou know I fucking love Julius Randle‚Äù you know, and...

**Russillo:** I fell out of love with him in the Miami series

**Simmons:** yeah I know but he was also... it turned out he was playing on a bad enough ankle that they had a surgery for it, you know so...

**Russillo:** you're right because whenever we do the all NBA stuff I'm like wait I think I have to vote right yeah I have to vote him in and then you're right he plays all the time...

.

To be fair to the Boston-homer Bill Simmons, he has been more fair on the Knicks over the last few years as the team has finally become a more-competent organization under Leon Rose. Only things I would disagree with from this snippet are (1) Toronto ain't making any trades with the Knicks, and (2) although Randle is underrated, frankly I think he's not even the most underrated guy on our team, that title belongs to ""28th best Center in the NBA, worse than Kessler, Sengun, Chet Holmgren"" Mitchell Robinson."

59,What Moves do the Knicks make?,"We checked in for Clint Capela, Jalen Duren, Walker Kessler and god knows who else.

What other moves are we making? Are we signing Precious? Are we trading for somebody?

Or is there a big move nobody knows about because the FO hasn't leaked anything about their plans? Nobody knew what we were doing this FA. Signing Cam Payne, trading for Mikal Bridges etc.

What do you think we're doing?

62,I think the Knicks have enough to win it all!,"  

Barring injuries of course.

Cause recently, like a plague injuries throughout the league are rampant and the Knicks have been at the top of the list suffering in this plague.

But, the good news is that historically a team needed first at least a superstar and a star to win in this league...plus very good role players.

Indeed, just this year alone shows us that merely having two stars or superstars IS NOT ENOUGH anymore. Look at the Bucks; look at the Lakers; Look at the Warriors.

Now the Knicks have two stars and one practically near superstardom, Brunson. And great role players who under Tibbs have been especially good. Not to mention the Knicks have two centers who are both worthy NBA starting caliber centers, and one soon will return from injury.

So, if Anunoby, Brunson, and Randle are healthy, and with the addition of Burke and Bogdanovic( a 20-point-a-game scorer) and the continuing super play of the role players, I believe the Knicks have the material, coach, and talent to win it all, or at least meet Boston in the Eastern Conference finals.

**Leon Rose understood what Knicks needed to become a bigger threat ‚Äî and made it happen**"
63,"2024 NBA DRAFT PLAYER PROFILE: Devin Carter, Providence","**Position:** G

**Age on draft night:** 22.3

**Height:** 6 ft 3 in

**Wingspan:**¬†6 ft 9 in

**Weight:** 195 lbs

**The Sales Pitch:** Devin Carter is a combo guard who rebounds like a forward, has range beyond the 3-point line, a boundless motor, and truly explosive athleticism. He‚Äôs a top defender in this class as well. A two-way scoring guard with dawg-like tendencies and athleticism is a recipe that has worked for the Knicks multiple times already, so why not go back to the well if you‚Äôre Leon Rose?

**Questions about their projection:** If Devin can‚Äôt be a lead ball-handler, he‚Äôd be an undersized 2-guard, always a dicey proposition. Additionally, this is his first year as a knockdown shooter off the catch (still a work in progress off the bounce), and his first year as an NBA-level scorer, so picking Carter is also a bet that his awkward but effective rim forays and slightly funky shot will continue being effective vs. pros.

**Important Stats:**

* 19.7 points/8.7 rebounds/3.6 assists/1.8 steals/one block on 47/38/75 splits. Pretty insane counting stats
* 60 TS%
* BPM of 12.3 ‚Äì an incredible number
* 2.9 STL% 2.8 BLK%, great for a 6-3 player.
* Defensive rebound percentage (DRB%) of 24%, insane for a guard.
* 40% on C&S jump shots
* 66% at the rim
* 89th percentile efficiency as a pick-and-roll ball handler
* 25 dunks

69,"Never forget the ""experts"" panned Brunson as ""a role player"" and ""the next Eddie Curry""","Just to remind everyone, virtually the entire sports media panned the Brunson signing when it happened and insisted it was the same old Knicks make the same old mistakes and throwing money at bad players, or way too much money at average players.

ESPN's Dave McMenamin called Brunson a role player and made it seem like he was laughing all the way to the bank after somehow swindling Leon Rose and the Knicks.

Others said the Knicks were ""[vastly overpaying](https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/the-knicks-are-about-to-vastly-overpay-for-jalen-brunson-01g6pvbj008t).""

**Probably no take was more awful than this clown at Deadspin, Stephen Knox, who called Brunson ""the next Eddie Curry,"" compared his signing to disasters like Joaquin Noah, and listed Fred van fucking Vleet, Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, Cade Cunningham, LaMelo Ball and Khris Middleton as his supposed superiors, and said he was the Knicks' Plan C after Zach Lavine and Kyrie Irving couldn't be had:**

Aside from the historically bad takes about the Knicks' side of the deal, I feel like no one is talking about the other side of it: that stat-stuffer supreme Luka Doncic sucks all the oxygen out of the arena, reduces his teammates to spectators, and very few people saw the extraordinary talent of Brunson because of Doncic, even when Brunson was spectacular while Doncic was injured.

I'm not a Doncic hater, but I feel like he's a pre-Boston Kevin Garnett type player who's gonna waste most of his career playing hero ball and stuffing the box score until he realizes he has to ""sacrifice"" to make serious runs at a title. In the meantime Dallas could have some really nice talent and never know it because Doncic is Westbrooking his merry way along."

Great article on the Knicks change under Leon Rose."
72,First time since 99-00 and 00-01 that the Knicks won at least 40 wins in back to back seasons. Last year and now this year. ,Proud of these boys. Proud of thibs. Proud of Leon rose. F the haters 
73,We're zooming past the second apron boys,"This is a post for any worried about cap implications or future roster flexibility with this move. This move is Leon Rose saying fuck cap implications -- this is the roster we are going to go to war with for the next 5 years.

**Being a second apron team does not restrict us from re-signing our own players using their bird rights exceptions.**

Here are the main restrictions of being above second apron:

* Cannot sign and trade for a player
* Cannot sign a player waived during the regular season whose salary was over the MLE
* Salaries matched in trades must be within 110% instead of 125%
* No access to the taxpayer $5M MLE
* Teams cannot use a trade exception generated by aggregating salaries
* Teams cannot include cash in a trade
* Teams cannot use a trade exception generated in a prior year
* **First round picks seven years out are frozen and can't be traded** (LOL we traded them away already)
* **Team's first round pick is moved to the end of the first round (regardless of standing) if they remain in the second apron for three out of five seasons** (Nets problem, not ours)

The fact that Leon Rose traded away all these future picks tells me he and the Knicks org no longer gives a fuck about these penalties and we'll be zooming past the second apron to ensure we resign all our guys, and that includes OG this summer.

Knicks would be paying a hefty luxury tax to keep everyone on this roster, but it's the one time we should be happy that Dolan has seemingly limitless pockets. If this roster bring us 'ships, screw the tax and screw the second apron.

We're not going to be like the Suns who ended up as a second apron team but still need so many roster pieces to fill out. That restriction on flexibility is killing them. Assuming everyone stays healthy (and all our guys are entering their prime years), we'll be one of the deepest teams in the league with this roster. And we still have this year and possibly next being under the 2nd apron to make further moves."
74,We Here season rookies,
75,Bojan Bogdanovic,Surely this veteran is fucking sick and tired of being a Detroit Piston right? Hopefully Leon Rose is looking at this guy and sending out feelers. 40.9% from 3 on 7.3 attempts when his teammates look like G-Leaguers. He'll be a great fit with us.
76,Knicks Draft Targets Tonight (if they keep their picks),"Even more than usual, this draft is incredibly hard to predict for the Orange and Blue. There are a ton of potential rotation players that could go in the mid-20s for this draft and analysts are all over the place with their evaluations. Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder for this draft. The Knicks own picks 25-26 which is towards the back of draft analyst, Sam Vecenie's 5th tier (Rotation Players and Upside Swings) which goes from 16 to 28, but just as many or more player from Vecenie's 6th tier (29-39) have been mocked to the Knicks in the first round, and the Knicks love to trade down, so it's almost impossible to project. That being said, I've picked a few guys from tier 5 and 6 that would fit what the Knicks' typically value in the late first under Leon Rose tenure: older, higher floor players who can defend. I'll go in order of their rating by Vecenie.

1. Kyle Filipowski, Duke. Smart, tweener big who can do a little bit of everything. He can dribble, pass, shoot, defend perimeter and the rim, but doesn't excel at any of them. Does defend either the 4 or 5 enough to earn trust from Thibs is the big question. If so, he adds some nice versatility as a fill-in or backup big.
2. Zach Edey, Purdue. Gigantic, uber-productive, older deep drop, post-up big. Record setting production, incredibly strong, late developing player with huge upside, but massive questions about mobility. He's only played deep drop coverage with Purdue. Can he play a higher line and learn to show and hedge and recover?
3. ""Tristan da Silva, Colorado. 6-8 wing/forward hybrid with legitimate positional size and fluidity, traits every NBA team is seeking. He knocks down nearly 40 percent of his 3s. He can handle the ball and make good passing decisions. He processes the game well and plays it at a high tempo even if he lacks great athletic tools himself. He isn‚Äôt an elite defender, but he‚Äôs smart, can guard his position and is a sharp team defender. Given the skills NBA teams value now, da Silva ticks a lot of boxes for a solid rotation player"" - from Vecenie Draft Guide. The Knicks would probably be pretty excited if he dropped to them.
4. Yves Missi, Baylor. ""Missi‚Äôs athletic tools are superb. While his 9-1 1/2 standing reach didn't stand out for a player of this skill set at the combine, it‚Äôs more than enough when accounting for how vertically he plays. In many ways, he‚Äôs one of the safer picks in the draft in terms of projecting rotation players. Players this big, athletic and hardworking rarely fail. Given his attitude, it‚Äôs hard to imagine him not at least becoming a backup center. Beyond that, he must clean up some of the technical flaws within his game and continue to grow more comfortable with the ball in his hands when the defense takes away his first option. I believe he‚Äôll be a starter eventually, but he has limitations. HIs upside is in the ballpark of Clint Capela"" -  from Vecenie Draft Guide. He's likely the most Thibbsy of all the centers who could drop to the Knicks, but do the Knicks want a guy who will take a year or two of development and doesn't have any offensive upside?
5. Tyler Kolek, Marquette. Potential TJ McConnell clone with some shooting upside. Sharp passing pure point who lacks ideal size and athleticism but is gritty, smart, strong, and one of the best passers and playmakers in the class.
6. Baylor Scheierman, Creighton. ""He processes the game very well at speed, even with his athletic deficiencies, and knows how to play within structure and scheme. He‚Äôll make extra passes and will help on the glass, lead fast breaks and then in the half court will help your primary playmakers by being a shooter whom defenders must guard tightly. His defense is the big question. Can he consistently chase and play in help? Can he defend on the ball? "" -  from Vecenie Draft Guide. With his good size, strength smarts and effort, he may have enough dawg in him to appeal to Thibs. He's really well-rounded offensively and tries hard and is smart on defense. He's one of my favorite guys as he could fit into the culture and provide some shooting and playmaking off the bench as a wing.
7. DaRon Holmes, Dayton. Versatile, skilled, tweener big. He's only 6'9 but has a 7'1 wingspan and decent athleticism. Can he be a Thibs big defensively and on the boards?  ""Holmes has several of the skills teams love to see in a modern big. Many are looking for bigs who can dribble, pass and shoot to help space the court and make decisions for their guards and perimeter stars, and Holmes can certainly do all those things. However, at his size, he faces questions about whether he can adequately perform the ‚Äúbig‚Äù parts of being an NBA big man. Can he rebound consistently and end possessions? What is his exact defensive role?"" -  from Vecenie Draft Guide.
8. Jaylon Tyson, California. My personal favorite. He may have the best big wing handles in the class and he's a great decelerator with a strong frame. That's a skillset that has had a lot of success in the modern NBA. His defense fell off this season but he was asked to do everything offensively at Cal so he may be able to rehab his defense with a smaller role.
9. Ryan Dunn, Virginia. 6'6, incredibly long, top wing defender in the class. He has the dawg mentality, length, defensive awareness, and intensity that Thibs loves, but he's pretty much a complete non-shooter from range and doesn't have good indicators, making free throws at only around 50%.
10. Ajay Mitchell, UCSB. Big PG. Bigger PG (6'4) who plays a little bit like Brunson, with decel and great footwork, playing off of 2 feet, etc. He has some shooting questions, as he only shot about 2 threes per game, but he knocked them down at a good rate and shoots over 80% from the line. He also has questions about defense and athleticism.
11. Bobi Klintman, Cairns Taipans. He's may be a bit too much of a project for Thibs, but he has the Cam Reddish frame and length that the Knicks organization covets and he's fluid and athletic. If the Knicks are willing to put in the time to iron out his inconsistency, he could be a multi-positional big/wing defender who can also space the floor, which would be an ideal fill-in for the oft-injured OG.

Who are your personal favorites that would fit best into the Knicks' scheme?

78,Donte DiVincenzo is what Evan Fournier was supposed to be for the Knicks,It‚Äôs a small sample size I know. But Donte is not only making his shots for us but he‚Äôs also providing solid defense that we didn‚Äôt see from Fournier. Leon Rose you cooked.

But I‚Äôm looking back to 2022 and I was with a friend in Atlantic City watching the Mavs/Jazz series and we just knew he was coming

Why were we so confident early on.

Maybe I‚Äôm messing up my timeline, but why did we just have that feeling Dallas wouldn‚Äôt give him the contract he deserved.

Like how did we know he was linked to us?

Anyone else have insight into what Spring/Summer 2022 was like before the signing that changed the franchise?"
80,What exactly is our FO saving protected draft picks for?,"Since Leon doesn't even use Knicks own picks to draft players anymore what exactly is he saving low value protected picks for? Anybody have any ideas because I don't... in the last year Spida/PG13/Dame/Harden/Jrue all this players were available but Knicks didn't trade for anyone. Leon Rose doesn't want to draft he doesn't want to trade for talent and he keeps dumping our assets for low low value some ppl here call this patience but I don't see the patience what do you guys actually think we are outbidding anyone for Embiid, Freak, Luka?"
81,Anyone else worried about OG contact?,I know Leon rose kid is his agent but wasn‚Äôt OG a priority looking for an increased offensive role? He hasn‚Äôt gotten many touches and his PPG is down so it‚Äôs worrying a contender like Philly can throw the bag at him and say ‚Äútake as many shots as you want‚Äù and lose him for nothing
82,The unspoken argument for Thibs being Coach of the Year ,"Every major contributor on this team is having the best production of their career this year.

Brunson 28/7 on 48% FG and 40% 3PT, should be top 5 MVP. 
Randle 24/9/5 on his best efficiency as a Knick despite awful start. 
Divo second in the league in made 3PM. 
Hartenstein‚Äôs best defense and passing of his career. 
OG was a plus/minus god and 15-2 when he played. 
Deuce went from the end of the bench to clamping the best opposing guard and shooting 42% from 3. 
Mitch was top 3 DPOY and leading league in OREB. 
Hart has all 6 triple doubles of his career this year. 

Thibs really gets the best out of his guys. We can bitch about minutes and injuries, but Randle was a freak injury and OG probably had this elbow issue dating back to Toronto. 2 years ago, everyone would call this group of players a lottery team. When healthy, they‚Äôre easily a top 5 team in the NBA. Thibs somehow gets the most out of these guys individually and as a team. 

Obligatory shout out to Leon Rose too. "
83,Was signing Josh Hart an Isaiah Thomasesque move?,"When we think of Isaiah Thomas, we think of big contracts to role players.

Jared Jefferies, Michael Sweetney, Shannon Anderson, the list goes on.

Josh Hart reminds me of one of those signings, the guy is a walking brick. He‚Äôs so bad at shooting he‚Äôs afraid to shoot.

 We play 4 on 5 with him on the floor the same way we did when we had Jared Jefferies.

Leon Rose needs to have his feet held to the fire for this signing man. We have no shooting."
84,Remember we could‚Äôve gotten Donovan Mitchell for the same package and more 1sts,"Leon Rose masterclass again, before y‚Äôall say but we would‚Äôve had 2 undersized guards starting‚Ä¶ who gives a shit, would you rather have Donovan or OG. And this was only a year ago too, what a terrible trade. Leon skimping out on 2-3 more first round picks just to trade RJ and IQ for a role player a year later is a terrible turn of events. A disasterclass of epic proportions smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
85,The Melo Trade wasn't Bad,"The Melo trade in its self wasn't bad, it was the moves afterward and the failure of Amare's knees that made it bad. If it wasn't for Amare, the Heat big 3 being formed at the worst time, and if we made some better moves after, then who knows what could of happened.

If we didn't do the trade, we would have the worst record of the century by far, be a greater laughing stock, and lose a great part of our history and one of the great Knicks of all time. Without the trade, the Knicks don't have their most successful run of the 21st century (excluding now) and the 54-28 season and 3 playoff runs don't happen. As far as giving up too much, I don't even need to give examples, but we know how much stars go for nowadays and back then. 

Wilson Chandler, a decent role player for the Nuggets. Raymond Felton, who was playing really solid, but not on great efficiency and we also signed him back later lol. Timofey, against decent role player. Gallo, okay he became a good role player, but shiver me timbers, the way Knicks fans talk, the amount of championships we missed out on by not having him or the others. A 2014 first-round pick, 2012 and 2013 second-round picks via the Warriors, the option to swap 2016 first-round picks, and $3 million in cash. The 2014 first rounder turned into the 12th pick, which is really solid, in 2016 they swapped our 7th pick with their 9th, which we sent away in that horrible Andrea trade, going back to my point of bad moves after. So take away the cash and two second rounders, one 12th pick (which wasn't supposed to be that bad) and swapping from pick 7 to 9, my God how much we set the franchise back lol.

The cap space and money aspect of it is also big. This trade  freed up about $16.5 million in cap space (yes I ran the numbers), if they don't do the trade, they would need to get rid of those players and find a way to free up the cap space anyway, like how we made trades and punted the 2022 draft to sign Brunson and teams do so all the time, even tho if it may seem like the value doesn't make sense. Melo signed for AAV around $21.5 million and made it clear he wanted the 3 year $65 million deal no matter what, he wanted the extra money and the extra year that could only happen if a team had his bird rights. He wanted NY and the Nets and Knicks were both destinations: he would sign anywhere he got the money, as he understood the Nets were moving to NY in an year. The Nets even had a trade lined up and met with Melo and his agent Leon Rose (LOL crazy to think about now) with permission of the Nuggets and were in agreement on everything. Dolan and the Knicks then met with Leon and Melo and swooped in and got the deal done with Dolan leading charge, but if they hadn't swooped in, Melo was a Net.

88,Two things on my mind,"First the cold war ending between klutch and leon rose is most likely going to be huge for us. Jordan Clarkson, Dejounte Murray, and Malcolm Brogdon are all under klutch. As the trade deadline approaches i wouldnt be surprised if we go after and try to acquire one of these three (I doubt Murray is a target with his attitude and weakness on defense as of late). The second thing is we are facing the 76ers three more times with embiid most likely being out for season. We are currently 14th in remaining schedule strength. With the 76ers being hampered I feel our remaining schedule strength is even lower than that. If the knicks are able to get a solid backup ball handler, I feel we have a good chance of getting the 2nd and at least the 3rd seed."
89,Player by Player 2023-24 Season and Postseason Review: O.G.

Shooting splits

O.G Anunoby had been a name that the Knicks had long coveted. He‚Äôs a supremely talented defender and a 3 point sniper, specifically from the corner. He also has playoff tested experience and can be a solid secondary scorer when needed. The Knicks acquired OG along with Malachi Flynn and Precious Achiuwa for Immanuel Quickley and RJ Barrett. Very sad. Moving. Once OG arrived he single handedly transformed the Knicks defense overnight. The Knicks starting 5 became the best in the NBA by a wide margin. His 3 point shooting and defensive versatility helped us shutdown several title contenders during an impressive run in January. 

However, that time was not to last. OG would go on to miss almost the rest of the regular season and would then be lost after only a handful of playoff games. Therein lies the ultimate problem, OG unfortunately has always dealt with that whole ‚Äúthe best ability is availability‚Äù thing. He averages 60 games played per year in his career. It‚Äôs not a horrifically bad rate of availability but it‚Äôs also not ideal. Especially when you consider that these issues tend to get worse as time goes on. Couple that with his contract demands and our salary cap situation and it certainly at least makes his new contract a slightly nauseating thought. More on that to come later.

Now here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting about OG and his impending next contract. His agent is like, Leon Rose‚Äôs son? Or something like that, I‚Äôm fairly positive. I‚Äôve always felt him being back is a formality. And it really likely is just that, however, there are some things that give pause about exactly how much we should be paying him.

OG‚Äôs advanced numbers show a player who has; value? Yes. Great defensive value? Yes. Consistent offensive effort? Well, that‚Äôs where things get dicey. Couple that with his injury history and now you have a little pause. Now, again, I‚Äôm not saying OG isn‚Äôt worth top dollar; he‚Äôs certainly worth a lot of dollars. But OG definitely has obvious flaws. Aside from 3 point shooting, his offensive game has limits, he doesn‚Äôt create well off the dribble and the numbers show that. His PER is below the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù threshold of 15. His BPM split, which is his overall net positive/negative when on the court is telling. His DBPM? + 1.8. Fantastic. His Offensive BPM? -1.3. That‚Äôs no good. That means that even with his shooting, his overall offensive contributions make him as much as negative as anything on that end of the court.

His defense rating in the league is 11th overall out of players that put in at least 50 games at 15mpg. Despite playing in just 23 games for the Knicks, he‚Äôs in 3 of our top 5 defensive rated lineups for the whole season, and 3 of our top 4 lineups for net rating. 

When it comes down to it; I think his box score numbers along with his advanced stats tell a consistent story. OG is absolutely worth a lot of dough. But he‚Äôs not with the max. You can‚Äôt give a max contract to a player who doesn‚Äôt have a full consistent offensive arsenal and can‚Äôt commit to being on the court the whole season (and more importantly, the playoffs).

OG was valiant in the playoffs. He was playing an incredibly strong series against PHI, logging heavy minutes. He was playing lockdown defense wherever asked and was shooting 3‚Äôs at a rate that the Knicks were looking for when they acquired him. Unfortunately, OG got hit by the injury bug again and was forced to miss essentially the entire second round (he gave it a go for the last game but it was quickly apparent he wasn‚Äôt healthy at all). He showed he was worth the price of admission however, providing the stalwart defense we came to expect along with the 3 point shooting.


**2024 Off season:**

OG is a veteran at this point in his career, so there are limited areas where improvement can truly be made. His defense 1-5 is top notch, so in a rarity, not much he can do to improve there. On offense, being a more comfortable ball handler would go a long way in making him a more effective scorer and playmaker. Otherwise, it's getting back to the lab and trying to find a way to stay healthy for a whole season. The Knicks will certainly go to great lengths to keep him, but you just wonder if there is indeed a limit. 



**Overall Grade for 2023-24 season:**  A-. 

Being a mid-season acquisition, OG obviously had a limited team with the squad. However, when he was on the court he was highly effective as a defender and a more than worthy shooter. He also stepped up big to help with the loss of Randle and other injuries when he was healthy. I expect to see OG back next year and hopefully have a healthy and effective year with the Knicks.

90,It‚Äôs‚Ä¶beautiful‚Ä¶,
91,"What if DAL didnt tank successfully, and we recieved pick #11 last season? ","How would have DAL not tanking last season impact this years off-season? This was prior to the OG trade and Donte signing but team needs were relatively the same. Lively would have definitely been seen as better than Sims and maybe the team would've valued Jaime Jaquez Jr.'s or Gradey Dick's fit absent OG? 

Even if our selection in 23' would've been used in a trade by now, I can't help but think we would be in a better place now with the 23' #11 pick than Kolek and those picks. 

Regardless, I love what our team did with the picks we did get and am glad those bums in DAL didnt win it all after tanking the previous season. aMelo. "
92,Taj Gibson was waived by Washington,"Time to come home Taj. 

This is why Leon never signed a backup 4.

The Rose knows..."
93,Leon is basically recreating Thibs‚Äô old Bulls squad,"Brunson=rose

randle=boozer

Will be interesting to see what he does next‚Ä¶"
94,These last few drafts have explained the bridges trade.,"Leon Rose must be thinking the bridges trade was great because now he only has to trade back multiple times every other year instead of every year.

"
95,"OG started the game guarding Maxey, covered Oubre when he was heating up then ended the game guarding Embiid",Box score watchers will never give credit to OG but dude's impact on the floor cannot be measured by box scores. He can guard 1-5 literally! Plus he finishes hard. I remember the play he was blocked but still flushed it down. I fucking love OG!
96,RJ defensively,"One of the biggest fallacies created by the pro-Knicks media and their cronies is this belief RJ is a good defender. 

It‚Äôs one thing to play defense and quite another to stop people. Over the last pair of seasons, the NBA has focused their attention on Thibs‚Äô defense. One of the things they‚Äôve found out is with Brunson on the team, their defense in the backcourt is vulnerable. It‚Äôs one of the reasons Josh Hart & Donte are here and Grimes was seeing so much time last year despite Grimes being a terrible all-around offensive player. Well, the league found out Grimes is trash and RJ is not terribly effective defending players with modest dribbling skills even if it‚Äôs at the small forward position. 

Last night‚Äôs 4th quarter was an example of why you can‚Äôt win with RJ on the court in the 4th. Not only is he a piss poor perimeter shooter, he‚Äôs also terrible guarding the dribble. On a few occasions, he was matched up with Banchero & Wagner. Both of these guys beat RJ with dribble moves that resulted in fouls or easy baskets. Lower center of gravity favoring RJ against both 6‚Äô10‚Äù players and they still managed to beat him with dribble moves. Thibs must have been steaming like broccoli. He goes small to be quicker and his SF can‚Äôt stay in front of a pair of bigs. It‚Äôs nearly as bad as IQ being beat off the dribble by Suggs and Cole Anthony in the 4th as well. 

People can bitch about Thibs all they want, but he‚Äôs short-handed with this roster. There‚Äôs just not enough talent. Hopefully, Leon Rose will fix that issue before the trade deadline."
97,It‚Äôs draft day,"And the highlight in the past 24 hours is us making waves with a blockbuster trade and bringing back a key piece to our rotation and talks of us being a legitimate threat to the Celtics next year.

No talk of who we will pick (and inevitably be the wrong one in hindsight) in the top 10 because we finished as the 2 seeed last year. I honestly like this feeling of not having to look forward to the draft because of a bad season.

It‚Äôs been a long time coming, Knicks fans. We deserve this. In Leon Rose we trust."
98,Who will get Tribute Videos on their return to MSG?,"Order most to least likely:   


* RJ Barrett
* Immanuel Quickley
* Obi Toppin
* Quentin Grimes
* Evan Fournier but it's just a video of the 2022 season opener and a picture of his salary cap hold

* Cam Reddish but it's just a video of Leon Rose thanking him for getting us Josh Hart  "
