13,Early Hornets Big Board: Fits I like for Dah Bugz,"​The draft is coming up and even though this is a perceived weak class there are some scenarios of players we can get that I'm very excited about and I'm curious what you guys think.

**Tier 1A:** Reed Sheppard

I'm heads over heels in love with the idea of Sheppard in Charlotte. I think our two biggest needs as a team right now first and foremost a point-of-attack/off-ball guard defender and not close behind that in second a guard that has some explosive ability on offense to both play next to and takes on ball handling duties without LaMelo. I feel that Reed was borderline made in a lab to address those needs. 

Let's start on offense. Sheppard is a marksman. The guy shot above 50% from three for the duration of the season on 4 attempts a game. He also has a smooth quick release that will allow him to be able to get his shot off against NBA-level defense in my opinion. 

He also showed the ability to play both on and off the ball and thrive with a number of different guards with different skill sets at Kentucky. 

He also showed extremely highly basketball character in accepting an extremely underserved bench role without ever complaining at Kentucky when frankly he was the best player on the team. He shows some juice as a playmaker he averaged 4.5 assists per game in just 29 minutes off the bench with a lot of those minutes being spent off the ball. 

Multiple guard lineups are all the rage these days but it's a lot more complicated than just sticking two guys together and saying you can never have enough playmaking See Garland and Mitchell in Cleveland and Young and Murray in Atlanta.

Reed I feel fits seamlessly in the best-case scenario of LaMelo being a healthy ball-dominant All-Star and also provides nice insurance for the scenario where LaMelo remains unhealthy.

Now for defense, this is an interesting discussion.

From appearances alone, Sheppard looks like a nightmare on defense. He is only 6'3"" with a 6'3"" wingspan. He is not a very explosive athlete laterally (we will get to his vertical later). But simply writing off Reed based on that is a mistake.

The guy is maybe the best hustle defensive stat player I have ever seen. He averaged 2.5 steals per game off the bench at his size and even more absurdly averaged nearly one block per game at .7.

That's where that 42-inch vertical comes into play. He had 2 fewer blocks on the season than Kentucky's starting center. Sheppard hustles like hell off of the ball and reads passing lanes exceptionally. 

He can be exposed in 1 on 1 situations by size and speed to such an extent that he will never make an all-defense team but he's far from a liability in total on defense and is any many ways an asset. He brings an effort and intensity to that side that we really lack.  


While he does lack the elite physical traits of a plus defender, he certainly punches above his weight and is an upgrade to anything that we have had at the position in quite some time.

As far as making a comparison, I think Fred VanVellet on the Raptors is a similar mold to what I think Reed can be here.

FVV started off as a UDFA who slowly made his way up the Raptors rotation.

FVV is even smaller than Sheppard at 6'0"". But, he also is a player that punches above his weight defensively.

While he was their backup point guard behind their All-Star in Kyle Lowry, FVV also became an excellent off-the-ball player there, especially during their title run.

Sadly, I think there is a good chance Sheppard is off of the board by the time we get to pick 6.

There is some downside of him being a tweener who is neither a truly explosive player at the point guard position and too small to be a high impact at the 2. In that scenario, I think his career could follow somewhat of a Luke Kennard, Grayson Allen arc.

But I absolutely love this pick and am rushing it in if I am Jeff Peterson and he's on the board at 6.

**Tier 1: Stephon Castle**

Not gonna lie, I came into this wanting to hate Castle. I looked at him as a non-shooter, who was riding the hype of a UConn team that won the title and thought that his desire of being a more ball dominant player was unfounded.

But as I've looked into him I've gotten really comfortable with him being the guy at 6.

Starting with the positives, as I said earlier, the Hornets' biggest need to me is a point-of-attack defender at the guard position and Stephon Castle is that guy.

He showed amazing defensive chops at UConn and was trusted with some of the toughest assignments in major games. He's 6'6"" got good size for his age at 19 in 210 pounds and a 6'9"" wingspan.

To have the defensive presence and acumen he did for a team more focused on winning the title than it was at developing NBA talent at his age was highly impressive.

I think he can guard both guards and wings at his size and do both at a higher level than Sheppard approaching that all-defense ceiling.

The offense is where his age did show he very much looked like a freshman at times with just inconsistencies throughout his game.

 His jump shooting was sporadic at best and more often than not just poor. He only shot 26.7% from 3.

He did get hot at times and is a decent free throw shooter at 75% so while hope is not lost on that end. Banking on him being a good shooter in the next 2-3 years is far from a guarantee.

Castle is adamant that he has more juice with the ball in his hands than he showed at UConn and wants more opportunities to play the 1 in the NBA.

While his offensive profile would concern me greatly if I were a team building around him as my lead guard. I do think that playing with LaMelo and Brandon will give him the space to add a little more juice to his game while not having too much creation responsibility.

This comparison is a lot more friendly than it sounds but I think a possible deluxe version of Nickeil Alexander-Walker for the Timberwolves could be the mold for Castle. Great defender that has more guard skills on offense than you typically get from someone who can defend 1-3 but not enough guard skill to really be happy if he was ever your lead guard.

If LaMelo can stay healthy, I do really like the idea of him coming along slowly as the defensive connective tissue and connector on offense in between LaMelo and Bradon.

**Tier 2: Donavan Clingan, Nikola Topic**

I am decidedly less excited about both of these options than the first two but there are some things to like.

Clingan could come in immediately and I feel replicate the role that Brook Lopez and Kristaps Porzingis played as drop coverage rim protectors for Charles Lee in Milwaukee and Boston.

He also shows some nice traits as a passer which could carry over from the things Boston's does with KP and Al Horford.

I think Clingan could be worth it even if we have confidence that Mark Williams' back injury will be fine in the long term. Look at Dallas with Gafford and Livley; their ability to have that caliber of center play at all times is a huge asset.

Downside for Clingan is he's a very poor free throw shooter and will be a hack-a-shaq target more than likely/

His upside on offense really isn't there, it's really a what you see is what you get proposition.

Topic, if we take him it's really getting into a best player available proposition because I really do not love the fit here.

He's a very high IQ player, and shows some really nice crafty traits and tricks of the trade. He's played at a high level professionally as a teen all of which are great.

However, I think he really does lack zip and explosiveness with the ball in his hands, he's a pretty stiff and rigid mover that kinda plays like he's stuck in one gear on offense. He struggled to shoot the ball only making 26 threes in 22 games.

That lack of explosiveness shows on defense as well where I found him be pretty poor.

He is a good free throw shooter so there is possibly some upside to the jump shot. He's a very smart player who I do think takes good angles and does crafty things to get to the rim and get downhill and playmaker for others so I do see how he can at least develop that out to the mid-range area.

He reminds me a lot of Josh Giddey, who is currently a bad fit with SGA and Jalen Williams, two players that I view as a very good blueprint of how I would like to see the team be built around LaMelo and Brandon.

On the high side of outcomes for Topic, I could see Goran Dragic on the Heat and possibly even a little bit of Franz Wagner, and I do think he is the best choice if the first three choices are off the board.
