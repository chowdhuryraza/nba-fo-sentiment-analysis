Yet you have fans already booing the f out of the players who gave us so much joy just last seasn. Even the horrendous teams that couldn't make playoffs prior, with subpar players who dont give effort, dont get such loud boos.

You also got fans complaining about EOTY Monte McNair not making moves, when its obvious we have to be very careful and sure now that we're on the fringe of being a contender, having a hist of crappy management making terrible panic moves or wasted assets. All that while Monte has proven hes the best in the business and knows his sht well (thats how we got here in the first place).

Add on to that, the criticizing of our franchise star who got drafted to us through all the bad, gave us so many great individual moments of happiness in those tough 7 seasns, just cause hes on and off for 1 month. Dude is probably the only star ever who doesnt say a word about not making playoffs in 7 seasns, playing in Sacramento and is perfectly okay with re-signing in Sacramento, yet fans cant give him a lee way for being off form 1 month out 7 seasns? while being the face of this Kings revolutionary beam team who is the only King to show up toe to toe against Curry when it mattered most with an injured finger?

25,Latest Intel about who we're looking at for the #13 pick,"This is from a recent ESPN article from Givony (which was posted onto /r/NBA_Draft). Here are the blurbs that are relevant to us: 

Jared McCain - 6'2"" PG - ""Teams say McCain is taking a different strategy than most players who are in his draft range, which is believed to be around Nos. 9 to 20. He is refusing one-on-zero workouts in favor of competitive 3-on-3 group settings. With most of the teams in his range also looking for shooting finesse, including Memphis, Oklahoma City, Sacramento, Miami, Los Angeles, Orlando and Toronto, McCain likely won't have a very long wait to hear his name called on draft night.""

Tristan Da Silva - 6'8"" Wing - ""He has interest from lottery teams, including the Memphis Grizzlies (No. 9) and Sacramento Kings (No. 13), and has scheduled workouts with teams drafting down into the teens, with the expectation being he'll come off the board somewhere in that part of the draft.""

Johnny Furphy - 6'8"" Wing - ""He should be off the draft board within the top 20 and has interest from the late lottery teams, including Memphis, Chicago, Oklahoma City and Sacramento.""

Kyshawn George - 6'7"" Wing - ""George will be getting looks from many of the teams looking for wing shooting from the late lottery through the early 20s, including Oklahoma City, Sacramento, Portland, Orlando and Toronto.""

All 4 of these guys are shooters (McCain - 41.4% from 3, Da Silva - 39.5%, Furphy - 35.2%, George - 40.8%), and other than McCain, they're also guys with good size for a wing. 

Da Silva is the oldest and screams ""Monte McNair"" while Furphy is the youngest and has some intriguing upside as a big 3 & D wing. McCain and George are both 20 and McCain is from Sacramento, so y'know."

# Final Thoughts

This guy has Monte McNair pick written all over him. DaRon Holmes II projects to be 2nd half of 1st round so maybe the Kings could trade down and pick up another asset in the process like trading #13 for #17 and #21 with NOP. I think he would be a great fit between Keegan and Sabonis or one of the first bigs off the bench. He could also play some center as that was his main position in college."

Three Cheers:

1. u/SendDavionNudes \- Monte McNair Executive of the Year
2. a deleted account -  Fox gets an all star spot and all nba 3rd team. 
3. u/prephal \- Kings have a better regular season record than the Lakers
4. Honorable mention: I said the Kings would have a better record than the Grizz - almost, not quite.

Three Jeers: 

1. u/brandorobi \-  Here’s a hot take…nothing changes 
2. u/TheLoKey1 \-  TD jumps Monk in the rotation at some point (must admit, I liked this one at the time)
3. u/4bigwheels \-  Kings will underperform and go .500 

Mine are as follows...

Team: The Kings defy expectations of a regression and earn home court advantage in the playoffs for a second straight year.

Individual: Sasha Vezenkov is top 10 in 3PT% at the end of the year (this would be >42.4% using last year's numbers); Keegan Murray averages 17ppg on similar efficiency.

31,Tom's Terrible Trade Ideas - Lauri Markkanen edition - V1.0,"&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Kings trade for Markkanen at a steep cost of 2 starters and 4 picks plus a second to free said picks. Atlanta gets an extra potentially high 2nd for freeing up the 2025 pick. Bulls get off Lavine for two younger players on overpaid contracts in Kevin Huerter and John Collins but one less year than Lavine's contract. Utah get a former 2x all-star in Lavine, solid vet for their prospects in Harrison Barnes, and 4 SAC first rounders.

# Lauri Markkanen's Trade Price

From The Athletics' Pistons trade article where Jazz beat report Tony Jones provides this nugget:

>In a big picture, Markkanen’s value to the Jazz is so great that it’s going to take an offer that is probably not going to come to pry him from the Jazz. Something like **four or five first-round picks, and a star-level talent** coming over.

# Atlanta Hawks

**Incoming:** 2025 unprotected SAC first, 2025 POR second

**Outgoing:** 2025 top-12 protected SAC first

**Note:** Fanspo still lists ATL as possessing SAC 2024 first hence their inclusion in this trade

**Important Question:**

* Is a 2025 POR second worth removing protections from the 2025 SAC first?

# Chicago Bulls

**Incoming:** Kevin Huerter and John Collins

**Outgoing:** Zach Lavine

**Important Questions / Points:**

* Is Lavine simply a salary dump at this point? Will the Bulls have to attach assets?
* Is Huerter and Collins the best 2 players they can get in a Lavine trade? Do their ages (Huerter-25 and Collins-26) make them more attractive trade pieces?
* CHI has shown interest in Huerter in the past. (HoopsHype)

# Sacramento Kings

**Incoming:** Lauri Markkanen

**Outgoing:** Kevin Huerter, Harrison Barnes, 2024 #13 first, 2027 unprotected first, 2029 unprotected first, 2031 top-5 protected first, removing top-12 protections from 2025 first, and 2025 POR second.

**Important Questions:**

* Will the Kings especially front office be willing to pay this price for Lauri Markkanen?
* Does this all-in move make the Kings a championship contender?
* Do the Kings need to take on additional salary from either CHI (like Lonzo Ball) or UTA (like Jordan Clarkson)?
* Are the Kings willing to relatively deep into the luxury tax to support adding another star player?

# Utah Jazz

**Incoming:** Zach Lavine, Harrison Barnes, 2024 #13 SAC first, 2027 unprotected SAC first, 2029 unprotected SAC first, and 2031 top-5 protected SAC first.

**Outgoing:** Lauri Markkanen and John Collins

**Important Questions:**

* Is this a big enough package to satisfy the Jazz's desired package of a star plus 4-5 firsts for Lauri?
* Does Zach Lavine constitute as a ""star"" for the Jazz? Is Lavine marketable enough for new downtown arena project and upcoming tank seasons? Is his contract too hefty to trade for?
* Does moving John Collins and his large contract in the deal add value to the trade?
* Is Harrison Barnes as a veteran mentor for younger guys and as a rotational player who can shoot worth taking on an extra $16 million? Does it even matter if the plan is to tank after this trade?

32,I completed more Kings related trades in Basketball GM and simmed 3 years,"I completed multiple King's related trades in [Basketball-GM](https://play.basketball-gm.com/) recently and some people asked for more so I thought I would make a second post with other suggested trades!

[First thread here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/191cmu4/i_used_basketballgm_to_make_common_kings_trades/)

Last time I completed Pascal Siakam, Zach Lavine and Kyle Kuzma.

I have put some rules in place to try and keep the game's relatively consistent:

1. Three Year Simulation
2. Cannot break up core of Fox, Sabonis, Murray + One (This rule may get broken)
3. Can only sign role players through free agency (Game considered Vet Minimums.
4. I can't change players / playtime.

Some things for you to note when reading this:

* This is a game, weird things can happen in games so don't take it too seriously
* The roster I downloaded is front Christmas Day so no Knicks / Raptors trade
* The game starts on day one of this season, so I sim until roughly today however this can mean that there are some changes in record.

&#x200B;

Alright let's get to it

&#x200B;

**Trade 1: No Trade (Control)**

I didn't complete this simulation last time and to be honest, this is probably the most likely thing that will happen looking at Monte's track history. In this modern-era, everyone wants instant gratification and if the team has a down week we would rather sell everyone than trust in Monte.

&#x200B;

**2023-2024 Regular Season:**

At the end of the regular season, we ended up being 2nd in the West! The team managed to nab a 55-27 record.

**Season One Summary:**

Two All-Stars, 6MOTY and, a 2nd team all NBA player. This is arguably the best individual regular season we have had yet. We see Fox having a huge impact on the scoring sheet and Domas averaging close to a triple-double! Huerter and Barnes after not being traded put together a combined 25ppg. The team made it to the second round and eventually fell to the Suns.

**2024-2025 Season:**

In the Off Season we made similar moves to the previous post:

**Out:**

JaVale McGee, Alex Len, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Jalen Slawson and Jordan Ford

**Season 2 Summary:**

Pretty average... Two all-stars again in Fox and Sabonis and another strong season for both. We see a dip in productivity from Huerter and Barnes (as well as pretty much every player). We also were bounced from the play-in by a strong OKC side (who knows how they were the 9th seed). Before anyone says something, the Lakers fluked their way to the WCF, unrealistic? sure, but we see miracles happen in sports all the time.

&#x200B;

**Control Summary:**

Overall, bit of a failure. We see Huerter continue to average around 13ish with a few boards and dimes in there and on the flip side HB drops completely off a cliff. The team overall trended downwards as happened in the last thread towards the third season with most of the sims. The team overall went 126-120 with a huge dip for the final season.

Overall, one play-off appearance (With that being knocked out in the second round is not what we as Kings fans dream to happen for this franchise.

&#x200B;

**Trade 2: Lauri Markkanen**

I think for the King's in particular this trade is relatively outlandish, especially considering the talent Lauri is and what we have to offer (without giving up any of the ""core four."") However, let's give it a run and see how we go.

\*This one had to break the rules as there was absolutely no way across three different save files

&#x200B;

I hate doing this, some King's media members have made the call that we can't expect a star by selling our shit. Monte has shown in the past that he is more than willing to upset fans for the greater good of the team.

&#x200B;

* Domas 3rd Team All-NBA

&#x200B;

**Season One Summary:**

The trade we made obviously had the team trading Keegan Murray which is something most (if not all) King's fans would hate to see happen with how many fans and Kings related people rate him as a prospect. Lauri in the first season out-performed any other player in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/191cmu4/i_used_basketballgm_to_make_common_kings_trades/) in the scoring column. He also showed an ability to rebound the ball and shoot at a decent click from three. Knocked out to future WCF team LA Clippers in the second round isn't ideal. 

Quick note, Barnes and Huerter both managed to play 20+ mpg and averaged a combined 19.9 / 7.6/3.8 assists.

&#x200B;

**Season 2 Summary:**

Less than ideal, play-offs through the play-in and bounced in the first round to eventual champions OKC. Another strong season individually from Lauri who averaged very similar numbers to what he averaged the previous season. The team overall had a worse season than the season they had previously. Fox showed out in the play-offs with close to 30ppg. HB dropping off a cliff similar to how he has in previous saves.

**Trade 2 Summary:**

Lauri individually always showed up as the second leading scorer on the team and consistently put up between 17-20PPG, \~7 Boards and an Assist. The team overall throughout these seasons went 120-126 which is an overall losing record. Keegan Murray never developed into the player we expected him (He never does in these). Overall the difference between this simulation and the control is that we made it through the play-in into a second play-offs.

**Team Stats:**

120-126

2x All-Stars

&#x200B;

**Score:** 5/10

&#x200B;

**Trade 3: Jeremy Grant & Matisse Thybull** 

This is an expensive contract considering the monster contract the Trailblazers gave to Grant. Personally considering Monte McNair has regularly mentioned wanted cap-flexibility I find this a difficult trade to see happening.

&#x200B;

**Kings Recieve:** Jeremy Grant, Mattise Thybull

**Blazers Recieve:** Kevin Heurter, Harrison Barnes, Chris Duarte & Davion Mitchell

&#x200B;

This trade ended up becoming a multiple-player trade as I had to keep throwing in players to make salaries match with trying to get three of Heurter, Barnes and Mitchell. I am more than happy to take back Matisse as I would also love to see him come to the Kings as a defensive 2-guard and also having learned to love him through his bubble content & play for the Boomers (Australian Basketball Team)

&#x200B;

**Season One Summary:**

The team dropped from 5th to 9th following the trade. Grant showed an ability to score the ball, he wasn't hitting his shots from deep with great efficiency (32.6% on 4.9 attempts). Thybull on face statistics was not overly appealing, diving into the advanced statistics he showed a 7.8 +/- on 100 possessions however due to his limited minutes this led to 0.2 win shares.

&#x200B;

**Season Two Summary:**

Overall, a great regular season and an average play-offs. Both our traded players have fallen off in all their major statistical categories. The fantastic record this season has to be credited to Domas being a freak and averaging close to a triple-double.

**Grant + Thybull Trade Summary:**

The hard thing about looking at these different trades within this game is if the traded players are contributing to team success. Overall, we see the team has been (relatively) successful through each of the three seasons making the play-offs (through play-in once) each season a bolstering an incredibly positive overall record. Grant in his last season saw a dip in both minutes and in counting statistics and Mattisse was a complete non-factor in each season. Fox leaving always hurts and it makes the final season slightly disappointing however the incoming players made an impact strong enough to pull the team into the play-offs.

**Overall Summary:**

Let's be honest, none of the trades in this group were as interesting or as successful as in the last thread. Our greatest trade as to date would still be Zach Lavine based on record and Pascal based on consistency.  Out of this group, Grant was the clear-cut best trade (The team was 16 games clear of 500) 

Let me know some other trades you would like to see as I am straight up enjoying doing these write-ups.

Cheers,

33,What new things will you be adding to your kings gear/accessories this year?,With the season getting closer and closer what kind of new stuff will you be adding to your gameday gear? Personally I’m retiring my streak breaker cowbell from last year and making (decorating) a new one for this year. Plus I’m making a Monte McNair jersey (it’s a puffer vest) after getting that idea from somebody on here.
