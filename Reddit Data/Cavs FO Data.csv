6,Koby Altman appreciation,"Only making the post due to the pessimistic comments that show up in our discussions here in this sub

Under Altman we have four incredible talents under 28 years of age under contract for the long term plus a crafty free agent get in Max Strus and a solid pickup later in the draft in Jaylon Tyson

If Okoro or Wade or Porter Jr or Niang improve and contribute a few key moments in a playoff series in the next two years, Altman could be executive of the year. Or if we trade any of them or the expiring of LeVert for a key piece

Regardless of whether we reach peak championship form with the current roster or after pieces of the roster are used in trades to build a new roster - Cavs are in such a great spot under Altman"

17,WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE. SACK JB ,"How many more SHIT losses do we need to have? JB has no offensive scheme, SUCKS at rotations, can’t get his team locked in, can’t call timeouts, can’t draw up plays out of timeouts etc. Etc.
Not to mention he barely played merril the last month???? Come ON 

This team is soft af and under this coach we’re a first round bounce waiting to happen AGAIN . 

More often than not we win games in spite of JB, usually behind an on fire Mitchell. When he’s out or not on fire we struggle because JB has no system and the team has no identity. 

Edit: Also we’re now 13-21 against teams over .500 I believe. Worst among the league’s top 10 teams. 

Edit 2: I also agree with people saying the core 4 is a problem. They clearly don’t fit with each other. Especially the bigs. My take is move Allen purely because Mobley is a better defender and has way bigger potential. The issue is JA probably doesn’t get many assets back for us "

20,Koby is either totally fumbling this offseason or he’s playing it exactly how he should be,"Slow playing a pivotal offseason is exactly what Koby should be doing. We really only have one, maybe two real moves that can be made. Every single move, no matter how small, reduces the number of options for that one big move. There’s a pretty good chance that the best possible move we could make wasn’t going to be in the window of the first few weeks of free agency.

None of the players we could have signed this offseason would have been worth losing flexibility for that one move. It’s highly likely this is also true for any trade we could have made. 

But this is only true if it has all been by design, and not the result of striking out and poor planning.

In 2017, Koby should have slow played things and waited it out with Kyrie, but instead, he got possibly the worst return for a superstar in the last decade.

Has Koby learned from his mistake and this is all intentional or is this the result of multiple strikeouts and poor planning? Only time will tell."
21,What was your main takeaway from our postseason?,"Curious the general sentiment.

I think what’s incredibly apparent is our four best players are only capable of filling two roles. While not identical, there is too much overlap in skillsets between Mitchell/garland and Mobley/allen. Which has been pretty clear to me and I’m sure many of you who tuned in to our injury riddled regular season games, particularly when it was the Jarrett Allen/donovan mitchell show. It was easily our best stretch all year. Now, these past few nights we see garland/Mobley taking the lead and our offense in totality looking at least as competent as it did through our first 8 playoff games. I’m torn on which 2 of the 4 guys I’d want to see go, but dear god please let JB, Koby Altman and George Niang lead the way out for them."
22,Evan Mobley in The Eastern Conference Semifinals:  • 21.4 PPG • 9.4 RPG • 3.2 APG • 62.7 FG% ,What a demon 
23,Koby’s statement on JB,"“J.B. is a well-respected NBA coach and an incredible human-being,” said Altman. “Over the past four years, he helped establish a culture that progressively drove players to become the best versions of themselves. Decisions like these are never easy, particularly when you look back at where this franchise rebuild started under his leadership. The NBA is a unique business that sometimes requires aggressive risk-taking to move a franchise forward and ultimately compete for championships. We owe a ton of gratitude for everything J.B. has contributed to the Cavaliers and his engagement in the Cleveland community. We wish J.B., his wife Nikki and their three children the best in their future endeavors.”"

25,"The other free agency decisions the #Cavs have to make are signing Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen to extensions.  It all really kicks off tomorrow at 6 PM.",
26,Comparing the Cavs situation with Garland and Mitchell to past use cases,"I posted this in r/nba, I figured I would post it in here too. Let me know what you think. 

If anyone has had a chance to watch the Cavs this year, you can tell something is not clicking with their offense. The team seems inconsistent and hard to watch, with a lot of iso ball (and that’s with Lavert hurt). Their two star guards, Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland, have struggled to perform together in a way that produces consistent winning basketball. While their individual stats are still good (Garland 20.8 ppg and 6.1 apg; Mitchell 27.4 ppg 5.7 rpg, and 5.1 apg), the team is struggling as a whole. The Cavs currently rank 24th in offensive rating and AST/To%. To try and improve this, many fans and pundits are clamoring for a change. While many believe it has to do with the coach (which I don’t necessarily disagree with), the solution may be more with roster construction. 

The two use cases that come to mind when examining two ball dominant guards in the same lineup are Curry/Ellis for the early 2010 warriors, and Paul/Harden for the mid to late 2010’s Rockets. 

As for Curry/Ellis, the two played 2 and half years together from 2009 to the middle of the 2011-2012 with minimal team success. Eventually the Warriors traded Ellis, and built around Curry’s strengths. The team saw having two ball dominant guards was not going to work going forward, so they traded away Ellis, the older and less efficient of the two (Ellis averaged around 20 ppg on 45/35/75 splits, while Curry averaged around 17 on 48/44/88 splits). It also helped they drafted Klay Thompson in 2011, the year they traded Ellis. 

As for Paul/Harden and the rockets, this shows a use case that was a resounding success, and even took arguably the greatest team ever assembled to its brink. The difference here is: 

A.) Harden and Paul are better players than Ellis (no offense Monta, but they’re both hall of fame players) 
B.) the rockets played four out on offense utilizing big men who could shoot to stretch the floor (I.e. Ryan Anderson, Trevor Ariza, pj tucker (pj actually shot 37%, not as bad expected) 

Comparing both use cases to Cleveland’s current situation:

- While Ellis’ case seems similar to Mitchell’s case now (older of the two, team has less contractual control, and less of an offensive facilitator than counterpart), Mitchell does have better shooting splits and is the better defender to his counterpart in Cleveland. Not only that, but the Cavs don’t have a Klay Thompson waiting for them (and that is coming from someone who still has faith in Okoro) 

- if the Cavs choose to emulate the rockets, than they would need to change something with Mobley and Allen. Either staggering the pairs minutes, developing Mobleys jumpshot by forcing to him play on the perimeter, or trade one of them to reconfigure the roster. 

While I don’t have a great answer to solve the dilemma presented, I will conclude that keeping the status quo will result in middling finishes and uninspired offense. I will leave the team building to Koby Altman. 

P.S. if you’re going out drinking and you need to get home, call an Uber/Lyft/taxi
