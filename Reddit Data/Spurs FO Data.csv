4,[The Ringer] Gregg Popovich will have a hard time keeping Stephon Castle off the floor.,"One of the pleasures of being an NBA elitist is getting the chance to introduce fresh new faces to the broader basketball world, so let me be the first to report that *Stephon Castle is pretty awesome.* There was simply no way to know this about one of the best players on the best team in college basketball last season because the only true crucible is summer league—the purest version of the game, spared from distractions like order and game plan and on-court chemistry. We can see the truth of Castle’s game in a glorified AAU tournament and, better yet, the single game of a glorified AAU tournament, before Castle withdrew from competition in Vegas with a wrist injury.

But what a game it was. Even in the summer league slop, Castle is an engine for intuitive, winning plays, connecting dots that lesser prospects wouldn’t see and manifesting plays that lesser athletes couldn’t create. The questions about Castle’s shot and position are inevitable, but those are almost beside the point; what’s most striking about watching him play against quasi-pros is realizing how difficult it will be to take him off the floor in the earliest days of his career. Why would the Spurs deprive themselves of a guard who comes by impact plays so naturally? Throw Castle into the mix and see what he can turn up, whether by jamming opponents up at the point of attack or slicing his way through the defense. Toolsy, theoretical players are fun and all, but so are the dudes who make shit happen almost incidentally, as if it were an entire way of life. —*Rob Mahoney*

Pop also said similar thing himself : “He’s gonna be a quick study I think and get to play on the court quickly.”

I do think he has pretty good chance to start beside CP3, like what SGA did at OKC. It's not uncommon for Pop to bench a player of Harrison Barnes caliber and make him lead the bench too."

There have been times in this building on Media day, where it was championship or bust, and then last year you said it was about developing these guys until you could pass them on to the next guys. You said you wanted to make them pros. After the draft of a certain player (Wemby), does that change the expectations going forward? What would reasonable expectations be? 


If you watch that video (the question and answer I’m talking about start at 10:51), I think Gregg Popovich tells us what we should expect this season and some of you may not like it:


“It’s pretty inherently obvious we wanna win”

“Adding more wins is appropriate, mandatory, helpful.”


I think PATFO will not waste any time they have with Wemby like other bumbling organizations would.

While they may not be expecting to win a championship this year, I also don’t think this is just another ‘development’ year and we just got to let the young guys develop and not expect better. 

The spurs know they have a generational talent in Wemby, and this season is all about seeing who can swim next to Wemby and who will sink."

21,Jeremy Sochan opens up on his struggles,"[Spurs' Jeremy Sochan opens up on his struggles to shift to point guard](https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/spurs-jeremy-sochan-opens-struggles-shift-point-18485472.php)

  
Re-iterating he was committed to making the position change work, Sochan after practice Saturday acknowledged the move to point guard the shift has taken on him

&#x200B;

 

There have been times during Jeremy Sochan's second NBA season in which he wishes he could go back in time.

He doesn't want to be a rookie again. He just wants to be a power forward.

That experiment as a Spurs point guard?

""There have been moments where it's like, 'Yo I don't want to,' "" Sochan said Saturday. ""It's like (expletive) this (expletive).""

Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has called the move of the 20-year-old Sochan from power forward to point guard the team's ""official experiment of 2023-24.""

Occasionally, that experiment has produced positive results. Occasionally, it has blown up in everyone's face.

This is to be expected.

""It is the first time I have ever played point guard in my life,"" Sochan said.

Re-iterating he was committed to trying to make the position change work, Sochan after practice Saturday acknowledged the toll it has taken on him.

""I am going to be honest,"" Sochan said, ""there have been moments where there isn't confidence.""

On the flip side, Sochan said, ""There have been moments of being confident.""

The 6-foot-8 Sochan experienced both sides of the spectrum in Friday's 117-110 loss to Minnesota. He committed a season-high six turnovers, including four in the first half.

He also contributed 14 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals, all while being asked to guard Timberwolves' All-Star Anthony Edwards.

As the Spurs attempted to come back from 18 points down, Sochan swished a key 3-pointer and found an open Tre Jones on a skip pass for another big bucket.

In nine games as the Spurs' starting point guard, Sochan is averaging 9.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.7 assists. He has been one of the club's best defenders, and is tied with Victor Wembanyama for the team's lead in steals at 1.1 per game.

""I am making a transition like this in the NBA, which is rare,"" Sochan said. ""You don't see a lot of people going from power forward to point guard.""

Popovich and the Spurs' staff have been unwavering in their commitment to Sochan to start the season. He says he has also gotten support from Jones, last year's starter who is now coming off the bench.

""It means a lot,"" Sochan said. ""If you didn't have that side, it would be a lot harder. It feels good that everyone in this building believes in it, and they know that it is not always going to be perfect, but they are there for it."""
22,Pop on Wemby and Coaching.,
23,Josh Richardson on one of Pop's rules,
24,Pop has done nothing since Tim (more in comment),"Gregg Popovich has done a great job since Tim Duncan, since he appointed himself as a coach.

He's done a great job to build a team around Tim, he liked the non ego thing, and it was the thing for Duncan too who backed up his coach.

Maybe it's why Pop chose non-american players, happy to play in NBA, less ego.

Since Duncan left, Pop always said he would have resigned, but he didn't. And since then, well, it has gone downside.

Kawi, Lamarcus, all wanted to leave asap.

Pop was Duncan area: since then, he has not retained any good player. Now Wemby is questionning his coaching, subbing himself.

&#x200B;

Maybe it's time to have the question.

&#x200B;

Edit : Sorry for all the people who downvoted me for speaking my mind, let me be clear : Pop did an oustanding job to keep a team around Tim all these years and win these championships.

But he has done nothing since Duncan retirement. He began with him and should have retired with him like he intended to  (or better, change position in the organisation, he has a lot to offer, maybe not as a coach anymore, and if coaching is tanking for his remaining years, it's not something I wish for him nor do I want that to be his last legacy).

Edit 2 : I was downvoted to hell for a post saying Vic subbed  himself, for stating a fact even him admits.

You are a cult, you are closed to outsiders (I'm french and a long term Spurs fan), and I'm a fan of many sports, never have I seen so closed minds where every critic is considered an attack against the dogma (don't criticize royalties).

Thanks to some who had constructive criticisms against my views and I learned from them."
25,For those that like to read former Spur Demar Derozan is releasing his memoir on September 10th. Foreword by Coach Pop 📖,
26,They still want to play for Pop 🔥,
27,Victor Wembanyama Keeps Losing. The NBA Is Still Terrified.,"The San Antonio Spurs are unequivocally one of the worst teams in the NBA. They’ve lost more than three times as many games as they’ve won. They’re one of only two teams mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. They’re on pace to finish dead last in the Western Conference for the second year in a row.

But to the biggest names in the NBA, the Spurs don’t look like doormats. They look completely terrifying.

The reason is a 7-foot-4 phenom from France who puts his phone on airplane mode at 9 p.m. to read before bed.

Victor Wembanyama hasn’t merely lived up to the hype that followed him across the Atlantic in June, when he was the most heralded No. 1 draft pick since LeBron James. He’s convinced the NBA’s best players, including James himself, that he’s ready to take over the league—and sooner rather than later.

“He doesn’t have a ceiling,” James said of Wembanyama, who is still just 20 years old. “He can do whatever he wants to do with his career.”

James made his comment after the rookie stuffed every category of the stat sheet against the Los Angeles Lakers: 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five steals and five blocks. 

Wembanyama had also tallied five steals and blocks the game before, becoming the first player to reach that threshold in back-to-back contests since another heralded young star did so in 1987. His name was Michael Jordan.

Wembanyama plays nothing like James or Jordan. In many ways, that’s the point. He plays like nothing like anyone who has come before him. 

The rest of the NBA has spent this season getting accustomed to a giant who, under the guidance of legendary coach Gregg Popovich, collects new skills as easily as he changes a lightbulb. He shoots 3-pointers more often and with a higher hit rate than either James or Jordan did as rookies. With his 8-foot wingspan, he dunks from more outrageous distances. And his defense is already in a class of its own: Wembanyama leads the NBA with 3.4 blocks per game and is in the running for the Defensive Player of the Year award.

Wembanyama’s statistics tell only part of the story. The NBA’s superstar class tells the rest. A kid who can’t yet legally partake of Popovich’s famously refined wine selections simply shouldn’t be doing the things he’s done, says the list of icons who have lately gone up against him.

In January, Wembanyama had a bruising back-and-forth with Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, at one point rejecting the two-time MVP’s shot. At All-Star weekend in February, Antetokounmpo licked his wounds and offered praise.
“There’s never going to be anyone else like him,” said the 6-foot-11 Bucks star. “People don’t understand. He’s like 7-5. I was standing next to him. He’s way, way, way taller than me. He can shoot, he can dribble—blah, blah, blah.”

The problem for the Spurs is that the lousiness that let them win last year’s draft lottery and land Wembanyama hasn’t lifted. None of his teammates has appeared on so much as a single All-Star roster, meaning Wembanyama’s performances often feel like scintillating trailers for a yet-to-be-released blockbuster. According to Player Efficiency Rating, Wembanyama is already the 14th-most valuable player in the entire NBA.

The next-closest Spur? Devin Vassell. He was 82nd on the list, entering Saturday.
In an odd way, the lack of help on the roster has only underlined Wembanyama’s bona fides. Opposing defenses focus their game plans on stopping him, and still he has burst right through the fabled “rookie wall,” scoring nearly four more points per game after the calendar flipped to 2024 than before.

“He’s got a target on his back. They’re going to come after him, they’re going to be physical,” Popovich said, adding, “He’s learning every night.”

Only one person in professional basketball, it seems, is unimpressed by Wemby’s rookie season. That would be Wemby himself. 
After matching Jordan’s defensive feat, he wondered if Jordan’s numbers came in victories or defeats. He hoped he could “look back and think this is a good performance,” he said. “As of today, I can’t be satisfied with a loss.”

The players who have spent a generation gobbling up championships are quite certain he won’t have to be satisfied with losing for much longer, as he matures and the Spurs build around him. In the meantime, those established stars appreciate their good fortune to be playing now, not later.

“It’s just insane how dominant he’s going to be as he gets more comfortable in the game,” 35-year-old Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant said last month. “Luckily, I’m on my way out, so I won’t have to deal with it too much.”"

Reigning Rookie of the Year [Victor Wembanyama](https://archive.ph/o/rPTBC/https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama) puts the Spurs in a different category than most of the teams on this list.

Year 2 of the Wembanyama era begins in San Antonio with a heightened awareness that winning 22 games and finishing at the bottom of the Western Conference is not acceptable with a player of his caliber on the roster.

How the roster improves will come down to whether management is willing to accelerate the rebuild this offseason and not next summer, when the Spurs could have up to four first-round picks and $50 million in cap [space. ](http://space.One)

One scenario in which San Antonio could improve now but not strip its flexibility is to sign veteran point guard [Tyus Jones](https://archive.ph/o/rPTBC/https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3135046/tyus-jones) and then look to trade for Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram.

31,"In what is arguably the most critical offseason of Brian Wright's Career so far, What would you rather the Spurs do - Draft 2 high-level prospects or leverage it to get an all-star/all-NBA caliber guy?","Case for each one (Curious to know what my fellow Spurs fans think)-

Draft Two High-Level Prospects:

Opting to draft two high-level prospects could significantly bolster the Spurs’ long-term potential. This strategy would align with building a young, dynamic core that can develop together, enhancing team chemistry and sustainability. Investing in top prospects also allows the Spurs to mold these players within their system, potentially creating a homegrown star talent that could drive the franchise forward for years. The Spurs have a rich history of developing talent through the draft, with players like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginóbili becoming cornerstones of our championship run. 

Leverage Picks for an All-Star/All-NBA Player:

On the other hand, leveraging draft picks to acquire an All-Star or All-NBA caliber player could immediately boost the team’s competitiveness. An established star could also bring valuable experience and elevate the team’s performance in crucial moments, offering a quicker path to success. With Gregg Popovich’s tenure as head coach possibly nearing its end, adding a proven star might maximize the remaining years of his legendary coaching career, providing a fitting competitive resurgence.

Given the current landscape and the team’s aspirations, which path would you prefer the Spurs take?

Instead, we are surrounding our core with vets who can elevate their game game and get us to the play in.  
Yes, we still need a few good picks in the future, but guess what, we have so many future pick swaps and other teams picks outright so it doesn't matter if we aren't in the lottery.  
Brian Wright has set us up to start competing NOW and to keep building as well. "
38,(almost) Comprehensive list of Brian Wright moves as Spurs GM,"Not only is our GM not bad, but he’s actually quite good at his job "
39,Brian Wright and the FO has really put us in a win-win situation,"It feels like no matter what seed we end up, we are in a successful position. 

The contract situations are very friendly to build around, and we paid Vassell before these huge contracts were being given out.

Chris and Barnes are also ready to be traded later in the season to contenders if they want and we can acquire some good draft capital through that as well. 

We get another year to evaluate and build with players. Some players, this will be there last year before we move off them. Players like Malaki, Wesley, etc will be on the chopping block and expected to improve at a certain place to stay on the team."
40,Can we relax on the brian wright slander now?,Filled out holes in our roster while keeping our stockpile of picks and started adding picks/pick swaps for years we likely to be competing for championships. Perfectly setting us up for sustained success. 
41,Is that Brian Wright with Wemby?,Wemby is back home in France and is watching Oscar's game (lil bro)... are we drafting Risacher?
42,Brian Wright has been prioritized Sizes.,"Our 1st rounders since Brian Wright took the helm

* Devin Vassell : 6'5 with 6'10 wingspan
* Josh Primo : 6'5 with 6'9 wingspan
* Jeremy Sochan : 6'9 with 7'0 wingspan
* Malaki Branham : 6'5 with 6'10 wingspan
* Blake Wesley : 6'4 with 6'9 wingspan

I'm not going to count Victor lol

He even tried to draft a listed SF (at the time) like Primo to turn him into PG. Pop also experimented Sochan at PG this season. I think the modern Spurs love PG with size. It's really difficult to speculate who will we pick. Could even be the one who isn't listed as PG, going into draft night."
43,"Spurs GM Brian Wright on the phone as Spurs Draft HQ (and Tim Duncan) watch along, prior to the announced trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves",
44,Draft day this June will be a huge test for Brian Wright.,"He's been overall so so (not too good, not too bad) during draft day since he took the job.

Devin Vassell in 2020 was a great pick. We got him at 11th and I think he's currently a 6th best player in that draft class, with a potential to go as high as 3rd or 4th best in the near future. (Ofc Haliburton would've been perfect but I let it slide because I'm satisfied with Vassell.)

Tre Jones at 41th also would've gone first round. Great Picks overall in 2020.

Josh Primo in 2021 at 12th was a huge bust. I don't think he'd make it as our star even if he wasn't an asshole.

In 2022, I think Jeremy Sochan at 9th and Malaki Branham at 20th would go somewhat similar right now in the re-draft. Blake Wesley at 25th would be out of the first round. Overall it wasn't bad but I'm not satisfied with this class.

Wemby was no brainer so that doesn't count. (Credit to him for trading Murray tho.)

This year will be really challenging for him as we'll get one high draft pick and potentially another one from Raptors. It's also no clear orders at all if we somehow surprisingly got no.1.

I just hope he will deliver. It's really crucial draft day for our future."
45,Brian Wright needs to be fired,"The Spurs are 11-48 and are having a historically terrible season. Let’s break down why this is all Brian Wright’s fault. 

One of the most important roles of a GM is roster construction . It is the GM’s responsibility to build a championship roster which Wright has failed miserably. The Spurs have had the 2nd most cap space two straight years and Wright signed literally nobody in free agency. The Spurs biggest weaknesses include playmaking, rebounding and shooting and he didn’t address a single issue this offseason. Our team only has 1 pg and his solution to our frontcourt was to resign two G league centers (Barlow and Bassey) and extend Zach Collins this past offseason.

Another role of a GM is drafting. In the past 5 years Wright has passed on Haliburton, drafted Sochan over Jalen Williams, and took Primo over Sengun. Vassell still a great player but these are draft mistakes that can set a franchise back another 4-5 years. Besides Wemby and Vassell, he hasn’t made a single draft selection that was impressive in his 5 year tenure. Im giving Wright this offseason to prove he can prove me wrong, but my faith in him has waned over the years. 

Lastly it is the GM’s responsibility to retain and hire coaching personnel . Within the past 5 years, the Spurs have lost several good coaches such Becky Hammon, Will Hardy and most importantly Chip England. The lost of Chip England is felt as the Spurs are 29th in the league in 3 point % this year after his departure and OKC is now the 2nd best shooting team in the league.  

To conclude I believe Brian Wright should be fired for his inability to construct a good roster, repeated draft mistakes and letting Chip Engelland walk in FA. The Spurs drafted a generational talent and somehow got worst this year.
"
46,Brian Wright mentioned about adding shooting in an interview for the coming draft,"Brian Wright: “... percentage-wise we’re towards the bottom end of the league, right?” Wright said. “So I think you obviously want to add shooting.” Source: San Antionio Express-News

Jeff McDonald (the reporter/author) mentioned about Sheppard and Knecht in the article.

Smoke screen? Any thoughts?"
47,Excerpt from The Athletic’s interview with Brian Wright,"The Athletic: With two picks in tow, do you see it as an opportunity to strike twice in the “best player available” route, or do you look at team needs now?

Wright: I think we have to take a step back now and evaluate that. But as your team starts to take shape, it’s easier to do a little bit of both. But when you’re selecting in the draft and selecting this high, you’re always looking for who can be the best players, long term. So we’ll take that all into account and try to make the best decision we can.

—

I believe this confirms that need / position is largely going to be ignored in this draft. We’re taking whoever the FO thinks will be the best player long term, regardless of fit. It makes sense since we could theoretically upgrade every position on the roster except for starting center. "
48,San Antonio Spurs' Brian Wright's Post-Draft Press Conference,
49,Honestly do not trust Brian Wright making draft decisions..,"He was the assistant GM for the Pistons, while there he helped draft Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson, and Darrun Hillard. All three are out of the league. 

He was with the Magic, while there he was the head college scout that helped draft, Andrew Nicholson, Daniel Orton, DeAndre Liggins.. before moving to the Pistons. The Magic draft Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo after he leaves.. 

I hope RC is the one behind the draft picks in the future. He may not have been perfect himself but he has such a proven track record. (We don’t need to mention Nikola Milutinov.) "
50,"[SpursReport] ""Spurs GM Brian Wright told reporters that the Spurs haven’t decided if new draft pick Nuñez will be coming to San Antonio or whether he’ll remain in Europe. ""All that stuff is kind of still TBD, but we're excited to watch him embark on the Olympic journey.” Spain is trying to qualify""","https://x.com/SpursReporter/status/1806471049699381268

What do you think of this? Hard to believe they don't know what they're gonna do with him on draft night. I mean, they drafted him, they should know. Or do you think they're playing the ""I don't know"" card because somebody is getting the boot and it's too early to announce that?"
51,What positive moves has Brian Wright actually made?,"We talk constantly about “shaking things up” but does anyone have faith that Brian Wright actually knows what he’s doing? Here’s his resume:

- Drafted Vassell who I like but over Halliburton who is a stud and was a stud in college too 

- Drafted Primo over Sengun… Nuff said 

- Drafted Branham and Wesley who as of now, have not proven they can be NBA rotation players consistently 

- Extensions for Keldon and Vassell which I guess are not bad? But not super positive contracts currently 

- Signed Collins and McDermott on pretty good deals 

- Drafted Wemby (no shit)

Is there anything we can point to and say “damn what a great move”? I’m not trying to be a doomer but why does he have such a long leash for losing constantly?"
52,What is Brian Wright’s best move? ,"We got a pretty good return for Dejounte, sure. Draft pick wise, Wemby is the only true hit we have and he gets no credit for making the most obvious pick of all time. 

What else has he done? Why do we trust this man to lead us to a title with Wemby? 

I am serious. Someone please tell me why I should have faith in this dude. "
53,"In what is arguably the most critical offseason of Brian Wright's Career so far, What would you rather the Spurs do - Draft 2 high-level prospects or leverage it to get an all-star/all-NBA caliber guy?","Case for each one (Curious to know what my fellow Spurs fans think)-

Draft Two High-Level Prospects:

Opting to draft two high-level prospects could significantly bolster the Spurs’ long-term potential. This strategy would align with building a young, dynamic core that can develop together, enhancing team chemistry and sustainability. Investing in top prospects also allows the Spurs to mold these players within their system, potentially creating a homegrown star talent that could drive the franchise forward for years. The Spurs have a rich history of developing talent through the draft, with players like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginóbili becoming cornerstones of our championship run. 

Leverage Picks for an All-Star/All-NBA Player:

On the other hand, leveraging draft picks to acquire an All-Star or All-NBA caliber player could immediately boost the team’s competitiveness. An established star could also bring valuable experience and elevate the team’s performance in crucial moments, offering a quicker path to success. With Gregg Popovich’s tenure as head coach possibly nearing its end, adding a proven star might maximize the remaining years of his legendary coaching career, providing a fitting competitive resurgence.

Given the current landscape and the team’s aspirations, which path would you prefer the Spurs take?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1cqgeyc)"
54,"Brian Wright’s comment regarding not getting a top level PG was confusing “The team that just won it – Jamal Murray is a point guard, but Nikola Jokic is also a point guard. How you look at these things is different than maybe it has been in the past.” Murray is without question one of the best PGs?","I know he was trying to imply Jokic handling the ball was a big part in their success and making the comparison of Jokic = Wemby to a certain degree but that was such a bad example because without Murray the nuggets and Jokic were average. That reference only re enforces the need for a top level PG even if your big man is gifted at passing/distributing. Murray’s passing, ball handling and outside shooting was a huge part in jokic and the nuggets being able to completely dominate games since it didn’t allow the defense to completely close in on jokic and over work him. Just caught me off guard since he seemed to by mistake give a perfect argument for why you should want to go out and draft a top level PG for your generational big man 😅"

60,"Why, yes. Yes he is.",
61,Anyone else suddenly concerned about Risacher?,Seems he performed exceptionally bad in combine tests. Little concerning if we trade up or land him at 4
62,"Trading No.8 pick basically gave us an unprotected first, 2 pick swaps, and Harrison Barnes ?","LJ Ellis :

I know that a number of Spurs fans are still upset about trading the No. 8 pick but this trade (for Barnes) couldn’t have happened without the extra cap room generated by trading that pick.

Add the trades together and the Spurs basically traded the No. 8 pick and a second round pick for Harrison Barnes, a 2031 unprotected first round pick from the Minnesota Timberwolves, a 2030 top 1 protected first round pick swap from the Timberwolves and a 2031 unprotected first round pick swap from the Kings.   "
63,You got any more of them 2050 picks?,Brian wRight doing good offseason work. If ATL ends up being ass that 2025 and 2026 unprotected picks are gonna hit like crack
64,"Before the draft LJ Ellis mentioned four players Spurs sources refused to comment on: Risacher, Sheppard, Castle and Knecht. Knecht might have been the name at 8 they traded out of last second.","Here's the article: https://www.spurstalk.com/spurs-big-board-3-2024-nba-draft/

Obviously the Spurs took Castle so it's notable that they refused to talk about one of their top targets (even after hyping up Devin Carter from the same workout with Castle). They've been interested in Risacher for a while considering RC Buford and Peter Holt both scouted him in person. Sheppard is undersized but based on intangibles/personality and the need for shooting I can see it, and some sources were certain Sheppard wouldn't drop past the Spurs. 

That leaves Knecht. Draft Insider Woo from ESPN did mention the Spurs were one team with ""strong interest"" in him a few weeks ago.(https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/1daazxn/givony_updated_big_board_with_intel/) 

Jeff McDonald from Express-News also has this pre-draft quote from Brian Wright where he said: “We broke the (franchise) record for (total) 3-pointers, but then percentage-wise we’re towards the bottom end of the league, right? So I think you obviously want to add shooting.” so a shooter was clearly an identified need. Listing the two targets for this as Sheppard and Knecht in the same article is probably not a coincidence. (https://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/nba-draft-preview-picks-19539233.php)

Knecht at 8 would explain why Spurs were willing to trade out. They might like him but weren't thrilled to take him so high considering his age and defensive flaws. I bet they were trying to trade down and maybe get him for better pick value but nothing worked out until the Timberwolves called."
65,What irks me about this draft trade is that ," 

Spurs were reluctant to Package both picks to Atlanta for the number 1 pick yet go and trade the 8 pick for a Super late first rounder Next decade . lol you can’t make this up . 
Could’ve had Risacher and instead we draft another guard who can’t shoot 
I have 0 faith in Brian wright "
66,Draft Lottery Team Representative,We will be represented by Brian Wright.
67,The Spurs aren’t pressing to be good next year (and that’s ok),"The Spurs want to build a consistent championship level team.

This squad right now is nowhere near that goal. Yes, we *want* to start winning more than we did the last 2 years. What are the best steps toward **championship contention** though?

Make short term moves like trading for a rotation shooter, sign KCP to a big contract, and maybe we could make the playoffs as soon as next year. However, we still have 3 non-big rotation players nobody on the other team is going to guard. Most Spurs fans don’t want to trade 2 of them (Castle/Sochan). The Spurs could push some chips in and turn this into a playoff team right now, but there is no practical or well-advised way of turning this team into a championship level team next season.

The Spurs want to win championships, and they can’t do that next season. A cold analytical conclusion then is the result of next season, whether we’re a play-in team, playoff team, lottery team, the point is moot from a roster building perspective; not for fans and players which I’ll get back to. If the Spurs want to win championships (and they can’t do that next season) their short term goal should be doing everything they can to maximize their eventual championship-vying window. How can they do that?

**Trading for future draft assets. They did that last season, last night, and I expect them to do it again in the coming weeks.**

Don’t get your hopes up for trades/signings meant to improve the roster in 2025. When the new league year starts, expect the Spurs to take on more bad contracts and stockpile even more draft assets. They aren’t ready to compete now, so they should be using cap space to grow their stockpile even further.

That stockpile will eventually be used. Ideally, some of your own recent draft picks like Sochan Castle and a 2025 draft pick turn into the next Manu or Kawhi. Then you hold onto all your draft assets and continue to stack young cheap production onto championship vying Spurs rosters. That’s unlikely you end up with a Manu or Kawhi level player. More likely, these assets are traded for a star player to be determined at a later date.

**Q: So the Spurs are just going to tank again?**

No. I don’t think the Spurs wanted to lose last year. They were just a bad team whose front office cared more in the 2023 offseason about adding future draft picks and holding cap flexibility than they did winning. That is probably going to be the same this offseason.

They don’t want to lose games anymore, but given the choice of getting a player that makes them a little better right now, and a long term draft asset that can be used in a multitude of ways in the future, they’re going to choose the draft asset. If that results in the Spurs being one of the worst teams in the league, so be it. That’s not the goal but since we can’t contend for a title the goal short term isn’t even about winning. The goal is accumulating more assets for when we do shift to trying to win a championship.

**Q: How long can this go on? When do we shift to trying to win?**

Brian Wright has said the players will dictate that. In my opinion, if next season goes anything like this season did, you don’t even bother to ask Victor if he’s feeling impatient. If we finish with a similar record next season as we did this season, I think it’s immediately time to accelerate to more of a win-now mode and stop accumulating future assets. This approach the Spurs have operated with the last year (and should do again this year) cannot go on any longer than 2025. There is no moving the goalposts back. We have to start trying to win after next season. 2 lottery ending seasons to start Victor’s career is not unacceptable. 3 would be.

**Q: Why not trade for a star now?**

I don’t see the guy that’s worth cashing out the assets. If they got Lauri or Darius or Trae cheap that’s one thing, but I don’t think any of them are going to be cheap. None of them are the white whale type the Spurs would really prefer to go after either. Outbidding other teams with a stockpile of assets will be an issue, but you’ll have to hope the player prefers to be in SA with Victor rather than OKC, HOU, UTA, etc. and helps alter his trade destination. 

**Q: So for real, this means the Spurs are going to tank again this year?**

No, I really don’t think the Spurs want to finish with a record like they did the last 2 seasons. Even if the top of the 2025 draft is enticing. If they do finish with that bad a record the consolation would be the lottery and prizes at the top of the lottery. Everyone is hoping the Hawks can somehow do that for us.

I think the Spurs want to win as many games as they can next year, but they’re not going to be super proactive in trades and FA to meet that end. The front office is going to firstly try to accumulate more assets, *try* to get some shooters in doing that, but the priority will not be improving the 2025 roster. The 2025 Spurs players and coaches are going to try to win but they’re going to have to do it without the benefit of a front office that cares a ton about how much they win in 2025.

With an improved Wemby, and an improved understanding of how to maximize his skills, I think we will win more games next year even as the roster is totally unoptimized to win short term. We played around a 40 win pace when both Tre and Victor started. Almost nobody on the team improved last season. The optimist in me says some guys will improve this year, even if it’s just 1 or 2, and we can fight for the play in next season.

I’ll be rooting for the Spurs to make the playoffs next season. I think all the players and coaches are going to fight to do that, but the front office’s job is to put us in the best position to compete for championships. The best way they can do that is by stockpiling assets this summer. Now is not the time to push any chips in."
68,"Juan Nunez is completely cool with being stashed, knows the importance of his development. His quote ""I'm a creative player, I like to make my teammates better, That's me"". Looks like another Spur in the making","Brian Wright loves this kids and is completely sold on him.

69,"[Haynes] Tobias Harris I'm told is expected to have ample interest from multiple teams. Utah, Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas, and New Orleans.

70,We're definitely signing or trading for a shooter soon,"Not some big-time all-star of course, but a decent roleplayer probably. Last season, we had Doug and Cedi as our vets that were our 3 point shooters. We currently have nobody who can shoot the 3 at league average level (or above) besides Devin and Julian now.

Brian Wright himself said shooting is a concern right now. I don't know, just seems like the team is definitely incomplete now. Even compared to last year on paper when (we thought) we had spacing covered. Now on paper, you can EASILY see it's glaring weakness. 

And unlike some people on this sub, I don't see the front office and Pop not wanting to address this issue in free agency as they would very likely feel that is counterproductive and harmful, especially for a development or ""tanking"" season. The Pistons currently have more players that shoot league average or above league average from 3 than the Spurs when you compare their lineup and our lineup (Isaiah Stewart, Simone Fontecchio, Cade Cunningham, and Marcus Sasser compared to just Devin and Julian. We seriously can't have that."
71,The Spurs equipment manager has been putting in work this morning,
72,So it's pretty much a given that we're trading for SOMEBODY who can shoot this season right?,"I understand we're entering another development year, but there is no way you can go into next season with this roster and it's spacing issues. Brian Wright even said that we need to prioritize spacing because we were one of the worst shooting teams in the league. This basically says we are trading for SOME kind of shooter this off-season. Whether it's a roleplayer or bigger name. Who do you think it'll be?"
73,"[Adrian Wojnarowski] ESPN Sources with @TimBontemps: The Sacramento Kings are agreed on a sign-and-trade that will land DeMar DeRozan on a three-year deal, send Harrison Barnes to the San Antonio Spurs and Chris Duarte, two second-round picks and cash to the Chicago Bulls.",
74,Just don't get cute with #4,"Take a look at the previous #4 picks the past 25 years. https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/4th-overall-draft-picks-nba 

There's generally a consensus top 5 of Sarr, Risacher, Topic, Dillingham, Castle. So long as Brian Wright doesn't reach for someone with the 4th overall pick we should at least be getting a solid contributor. If we really knock it out of the park, it's potentially a HOF level player like Bosh or Paul. 

Tldr; take the best player available at #4"
75,Wemby is playing at an all star level!… do we make moves?,"Lighting a fire today. I seen this throughout the subreddit so let’s speak on it!

Do we make trades to compete as soon as possible or do we develop more and build through the draft? 

Let’s drop some stats. 

[Wemby is playing at an all star level statistically speaking](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1747242299438883313?s=46) 

[He takes the 4th hardest shots amongst bigs in the league](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1745430365265621009?s=46) 

But at the same time 
[Wemby is the only big that ranks in the 95th percentile across blocks, steals and deflections.](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1745792747687248369?s=46)

He is a [top ten forward](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1746306134170816539?s=46) and [a top ten mobile big](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1747351767246069964?s=46) according the D-Lebron stat. A stat known to encompass majority of impact factors and stats. 

[He is the third best differential of players shooting worse when being defended by Wemby for more than 10 shots](https://twitter.com/spurs_nation/status/1747662649981026810?s=46)

[He is also the number one rookie in the D-Lebron stat as well.](https://twitter.com/the_bball_index/status/1747400337986891955?s=46)

[Over his last 8 games he ranks second in the NBA for efficiency per minute behind Embiid.](https://twitter.com/nba_university/status/1747257860474720334?s=46) 

He’s in the top 40  in the NBA for points per game, leading the league and blocks per game, leading the league in blocks+steals, top 10 in rebounds. And put out a number historic performances. He also has put up 30pts against AD, 27pts on giannis on a minutes restriction, and 22pts against jokic in 25 mins before the minutes restriction. 

Now knowing all this, we had expectations of Wemby being generational… not sure how many of us predicted a borderline all star and defensive player of the year in his rookie year.

Since Wemby is ahead of schedule should we push faster to build around Wemby and surround Wemby with competitive talent and use our draft picks for proven talent to maximize our window to compete or do we build through the draft and develop our talent so that our supporting talent develops as well and do smaller trades to round out the roster.

Pros - Wemby being an all star talent already and adding more of similar more proven talent can have his competing in playoffs giving him early experience he can use for his career allowing him to compete at the highest level for longer as our best player. It seems we are starting to see a winning formula as of late but the supporting cast seems several years away from that. We can expedite the process through strategic trades.

Cons - Wemby still hasn’t have a reliable jump shot, struggles with heavy contact and has a questionable motor. He still can use a stronger base so he doesn’t get pushed around by heavier bigs and forwards. He hasn’t gone through the adjustment from season to season and this summer he will be competing for France so it’s not likely he will do an extremely large jump between this year since he won’t be working on his craft the entire summer compared to other players not competing. Also it is a risk to have him compete. To extend his career precautions should be made. 

What do we think? It’s been said across the subreddit? If Wemby is playing at this level now do we wait until he rounds out his issues and get more experience or seeing how he plays now, we start to push to get to a competitive playoff level and maximize Wemby’s window? 

I already know how I feel but since others have been discussing around it why not bring it to the forefront.

Thoughts?"
76,I’m crushed. Someone please help me cope with what we just did. ,Please I just need someone to convince me that Dilly would’ve been a bust and that we’re better off trading for someone born in 2012. 
77,"A better idea than tanking (tamper, don't tank) ","I've seen a lot of buzz lately about the Spurs potentially tanking, specifically trying to get Flagg or Traore.

 Truthfully I don't think it's worth it for Flagg anyway. Traore fills a much bigger need and is an absolutely perfect fit with Wemby and has a massive superstar ceiling. Flagg is still the better prospect but there's diminishing returns for his skills given how much overlap it has with Wemby. If by some miracle the Spurs landed #1 in the lottery it would be better for them to trade down to #2 and still land a likely superstar in Traore. Teams would give up super high value assets to move up from #3/#2 to #1 for Flagg. Traore + big assets for #1 is a perfect scenario for Spurs but incredibly unlikely.

In reality, we have to ensure that the future is not decided by a random lottery. There needs to be a guarantee. 

So the true path forward is not to tank for Traore/Flagg. The true path is to TAMPER instead of TANK. 

Here is the roadmap: 

1. Traore gets drafted by some pathetic shit organization like the Pistons/Hornets/Wizards whoever. 

2. Traore stays with them for 2 years, meanwhile Wemby constantly texts/calls/sexts with him behind the scenes and plays up their French chemistry and becomes his best friend when they link up with the national team. 

3. Traore knows deep down he doesn't wanna waste his career in a dumpster like Hornets/Wizards/whoever, and starts demanding a trade as soon as he can. 

4. Traore either forces them to trade him after year 3 or they can let him walk after year 4. Spurs can pay his extra salary that he would've been eligible for with his draft team through some combination of money laundering under the table and hooking him up with the croissant sponsorships with Wemby. 

5. Spurs get a young but developed Traore right around when Wemby is in his prime and the dynasty begins. 


If you've read this far, you know that this is the correct path forward. Yes, I am a genius. Yes, I should be GM in place of Brian Wright. 


TL/DR: Tamper for Traore, don't tank.

78,What are the flaws that are causing this losing slump?,
79,Rob trade was highway robbery ,Can’t wait to get our next super star in 2031 with another 1st pick 
80,Wemby going back to Tre Jones after spending time with Trae Young,
81,At risk of getting hate I have to ask- Does anyone else still have a bad feeling about how the Spurs handled the Primo situation given the reported timeline of events? Specifically our GM knowing for months yet keeping Primo protected,"I waited for all the reports about what actually happened and what I’ve gathered is that Primo was constantly showing his P**** to the victim over the course of months and early on she told the spurs front office and our GM did nothing. Reportedly just asked to keep it under wraps and keep seeing primo and then avoiding her request for a meeting and some sort of action to be taken. Reportedly she kept asking if Pop knew and was told he DID (but she did report she thinks she was being lied too about that part) All the time Primo continued to expose himself to her and this was all known at the very least by Brian Wright yet he not only didn’t do anything but also kept pushing for Primo with a contract and making him the face of the Spurs marketing campaign with Self. And it wasn’t until after he exposed himself to members of the hotel staff that any action was taken (and it’s implied this was only done because it involved victims out of the spurs control) after all this Spurs throw money at her and cut Primo but allowed Brian Wright and the entire front office that was involved and knew about the situation to keep their jobs and continue like nothing happened? / I was hoping this was all just a misunderstanding but the spurs just throwing money at her and then acting like nothing happened in regards to the GM and front office knowing for months left me with a really sour taste about everything. I always loved that our team and organization was known as the 1st class no nonsense team that does stuff the right way and values morals and high character yet nothing was done other than the bare minimum in cutting the player they could protect. Adding on to the weirdness they hire her back on???? Reports were this was essentially a form of insurance for them and her so that she receives continued $$$ with the expectation she doesn’t discuss anything about this anymore. Essentially paying for her continued silence. 

I love the team love our player and love everything we stand for which is what makes this reported timeline so strand and disheartening. I’m still hoping there’s going to be some update making this make sense because as it stands out FO and GM look REALLY bad."
82,"Spurs may have something up their sleeve says this article, I kinda agree","It essentially tells us these 3 things

1) The Spurs' savvy move will make a quicker impact than people expect.

2) This is not a move that kicks the can down the road for the Spurs.

3) GM Brian Wright has attempted to communicate their intentions with clarity without giving away the game plan"
83,Forward thinking…. Maybe?,"Being an NBA GM is like working through quantum entanglement. For every decision you make multiple outcomes are possible and each possibility has multiple unforeseen consequences. When the Spurs lost Leonard who could have foreseen  us getting wemby all these years later. If we had taken the lakers offer back then we could be the pelicans today. 

All this to say, maybe there is a good reason not to draft a pt guard. Stay with me here. I don’t like the idea of drafting for need, and I wasn’t sold on Topic, but if you want to talk maximizing value then maybe Topic with the best possible outcome is an all star lever point guard in 5 years. In this outcome he would certainly have more value than picks in 30/31. With salaun off the board I immediately thought Topic would be the pick. It stung even more to see OKC get him. 

In an alternate city on the other side of the country could be my reason not to draft Topic. In the age of the second apron, Boston is sitting at a $190 million cap. They don’t need to make any big decision till next yr but looking off in the distant future I see Horford retiring after next season and Tatum has 2 years left on his contract. Basically the money crunch will force some tough decisions. Where the spurs become entangled is White has 1 more year on his contract. Boston has to keep Tatum and replace Horford in the second yr of being in the second apron. Boston can resign White if they want to but the penalties might be too much. The Spurs could simply let it play out and use their cap space to sign him after next yr. If they make a big offer I would think we would be his first choice. The other option is to be more proactive. Make Boston an offer. Show them the inevitability of it all. Maybe Chicago’s pick would do it. It might be a little rich knowing he will be a free agent but it would get the job done. Can you imagine a more perfect outcome for the Spurs? White is tailor made for playing with Wemby. He can run the pick and roll at an all nba level. He can play off ball. He can space the floor and defend. More importantly he is the perfect point guard for this team. Maybe Brian Wright is the GM we need after all. "
84,NBA Expansion Draft,"With the NBA set to expand in the near future, I thought this might be a fun exercise! If you were Brian Wright, which EIGHT players would you put on the protected list? You can only select players under contract or RFAs! "
85,Timberwolves Reddit is celebrating the Draft Robbery ,"Brian wright Might aswell be the GM of Minnesota now .,seriously WTF is the front office doing .  Horrible trade "
86,A perspective on this Spurs season.,"Bottom Line Up Front: The Tank is over, but the rebuild rolls on. 

Coming out of the draft, there was a lot of talk about this team trying to compete right away. ""Trade the picks! Go get Dame! Grab Austin Reeves/Fred VanVleet! etc.""  Nothing happened. Next was the Spurs remaining active in off-season trades grabbing big player salaries for assets. Then they waived 3 of the 4 players they traded for.  

Only a few players who are expected to make the roster over 25 years old, the takeaways from media day and the first day of camp are they all believe that it's winning time in San Antonio. I expect confidence and bravado out of any player about winning, but now we hear it from the coach too. It's a different feeling than Pop telling the world to not to bet on the team to win the championship last year, but at the same time. The team is ready to perform and start winning. 

On the other hand, the front office still has their eyes on the future. With upwards of 11 1st round picks over the next 5 years, Brian Wright see's no need to rush. The team has multiple bites at the draft apple and the team is going to look very different in the next 3-5 years, save for maybe 2 or 3 guys. Also, it allows for cap flexibility and trade capital that can benefit the Spurs as a small market team with a superstar they want to keep around (see G. Antetokounmpo). A home grown core lasts much longer than expensive free agents. There's no reason to spend that capital before they know what they have. 

So to wrap up, this team will try to win every game all season. There won't be extensive stints on the injured list when not really needed and there won't be experimenting with G-Leaguers down the stretch to 'see what they have in a guy.' But there will probably still be more Ls than Ws. I don't think this means they can't compete for a playoff spot or at least a shot at the play-in tourney, however in a loaded Western Conference where 12-13 teams are going for it this year, win's will be hard. The only guarantee is this season will be a lot more fun than last year. 

Thoughts? Am I way off base? Did I miss an obvious thread that could change everything? Is this the most exciting pre-season since the start of the '17-'18 season when Kawhi was going to come back from injury and exact revenge on Zaza and the Warriors?
