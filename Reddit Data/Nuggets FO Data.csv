7,Free Agency Overview 2024 [OC] [LONG]," 

Welcome to the Michael Porter Truther free agency preview for summer 2024.

There are **219** players who have options or contracts ending this summer. Given all indications from Booth/Malone/Kroenke, Denver is unlikely to make any large trades to their main rotation this summer, meaning we will mostly be looking for players on the margins. Vet minimums, forgotten players, ect to touch up the edge of the rotation. Even if we do something along the lines of trading Reggie and Zeke at the draft before KCP resigns, we will still be in this position. The following is under that assumption.

Here are the Nuggets free agents:

1. Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious (Player Option)- Hopefully we re-sign but likely will decline his option and hit FA
2. Jackson, Reggie (player option, likely opt in) - Trade Salary filler
3. Gillespie, Collin (Two-Way) - Played over Pickett all of last year and is the same age, so I have to assume CG is the main guy we want to keep out of the 2-way guys
4. Holiday, Justin- may look for a Jeff Green type contract after a decent playoff run. Why make 2 mil instead of 5-8?
5. Huff, Jay (Two-Way)
6. Jordan, DeAndre - May retire
7. Key, Braxton (Two-Way)
8. Cancar, Vlatko (team option) - Cheap and likely Denver will pick up that team option

How will we fill in any roster spots left by these guys? Let's look at the remaining 211 guys on the market.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

First, here are the players that I believe are clearly not options for us.

These are

* Young players hitting RFA where their team wants to keep them (Vukcevic/Emoni Bates)
* Players with a player option that is larger than what Denver could offer, leading to them opting in with their current teams (Richaun Holmes/Kevin Love)
* Players in demand who will get large contract offers that we can't come close to touching (Lebron/PG)
* Players with team options that will get exercised due to their great play on their current cheap deal (Alvarado/Mo Wagner)
* Players where outside circumstances make a move very unlikely (Thanasis/Morris Brothers).

Next, we look at the Old, the Bad, and the Ugly. These are guys that we shouldn't target as they aren't good enough.

* Fringe NBA guys that don't play minutes on bad teams (Kira Lewis Jr, Usman Garuba, ect)

Now we get into the actual meat and potatoes of Free Agency. Here are the ""OK"" options. If you're on this list it means maybe you could squeeze out a MLE somewhere and not be available, maybe the fit isn't great, but maybe they can play a role off the bench and work for us for regular season depth or be an 7th- 8th man in the playoffs.

  
**THE MAYBE LIST**

1. Bullock Jr., Reggie - Was a solid role player in Dallas for ages before getting exiled to Houston. Didn't play much behind their glut of youth but could be a Justin Holiday type player for us off the bench with higher upside as a shooter.
2. Burks, Alec - NYK might want him back after he played great on the Hospital Knicks team in the playoffs, but the old trade throw in showed he can still shoot, ball handle, and most importantly draw fouls at an NBA level even against playoff competition.
3. Covington, Robert - He's only here because he may be washed, but even 70% of Old ROCO would be a revelation for Denver. Can legitimately guard 1-5, shoots 34-38% from 3, passes well. A connecting player for any bench lineup and running Mike/AG/ROCO as the frontcourt for non-Jokic minutes would overwhelm most teams with length.
4. Crowder, Jae - The bucks might keep him after giving up 1000 second round picks for him, but the old dreadhead can still shoot well from each corner and play strong/physical defense. Could be a solid 3/4 to play with the AG at center/MPJ at PF bench lineups.
5. Dinwiddie, Spencer - I've never been high on Dinwiddie (Dinshittie???) but he is an NBA level PG who can space the floor, ball handle, draw fouls. I think he looks way better using his size against bench units that typically cannot defend a big guard like him successfully. If we give Jamal B2Bs off then he'd be fine. Might be available at the min after a terrible run with LA this season. What better way to rebuild your value than play with Jokic and shoot a bunch of open 3s?
6. Dunn, Kris - Unbelievably underrated player. He'd be a top choice if it wasn't likely Utah (or someone else) throws a bag of money at him. If he slips through the cracks, our bench PG problem is solved for a year. Great POA defense, ballhandling. Up to 36.5% from deep this last year. Would be in the playoff rotation for sure.
7. Garza, Luka - Unsure he's available at a min, but he's looked serviceable as a backup big when KAT was out with various injuries the last few years. Anytime Reid goes into the starting lineup and Garza mans the bench, he can be an offensive force. Could keep our heads above water in non-jokic minutes.
8. Hayward, Gordon - Injury prone, completely non factor in the playoffs for OKC. Both have tanked his demand... still might demand some money given he's a former borderline all star. But another guy who could slip through the cracks given the new CBA scaring a lot of teams away from any contracts. Would be a nice secondary ballhandler, scorer, veteran presence for the bench. I think a young team will overpay to have him mentor their guys though.
9. Highsmith, Haywood - I don't love signing ex-miami role players because they generally win by trying harder than everyone else. But he shot 40% from 3 this season, defends well, and is a Rich Man's Justin Holiday replacement. Started 20 games this season for a Heat team riddled with injuries and looked solid in most of them. Don't think he's going to be available but I didn't think Bruce Brown would be available for the MLE two summers ago.
10. Horton-Tucker, Talen - The Jazz became infinitely better as soon as they benched THT for Dunn, not a huge fan of his game. That said, he can playmake, score, and defend better than Reggie Jackson. Turnover prone and not a playoff Rotation guy imo, but if the FO is really not loving Gillespie or Pickett, he could do in a pinch until the deadline/buyout market. Good potential, maybe just needs better team culture? Or it could just be low BBIQ.
11. Kornet, Luke -Solid bench big who can shoot, rebound and give Jokic a breather. Boston likely can't afford anything because of their contract situation exploding next year and he is an ""unsexy"" pick for backup big relative to Drummond. Would be a great get but we might get priced out of him if some team offers 2/17 or something of that nature.
12. Lowry, Kyle - The old train is still chugging. Would be a great bench PG, philly had him closing lineups in the playoffs. Defends, shoots, playmakes, flops at a high level. Old man could organize the young guns on the bench as well. Don't think he slips through the cracks and philly might well keep him, but I'd like to see us scoop him if possible.
13. Martin, KJ - Freak athlete, very solid defender. Got forgotten on the edge of philly's bench but would be a good CB replacement if KCP leaves and we have a CB sized hole in the bench. Pure energy, would work well with a bench that loves to get out and run in transition.
14. McDermott, Doug - Great shooter, terrible defender. Would be a regular season pickup but could space the floor well for CB and PWAT to attack the paint, and the other bench players could likely cover for his defensive weakness. Decent fit and will likely be available. Not a playoff rotation player though.
15. Okeke, Chuma - Lost in the Magic's glut of young wings, Chuma was a solid defender on a young magic team, and used to start a solid amount of games for them. Unfortunately his shooting fell off a cliff in minimal minutes last year. Was a near lottery pick for a reason, and Orlando just happened to get two stars that play his position. A shoot the moon type signing, unlikely to crack the playoff rotation but could refresh the youth on the team if we pull some trade that involves Strawther, Watson, Tyson, ect.
16. Payne, Cameron - Basically Reggie Jackson at this point. Only sign if we trade away reggie and CG and Pickett are terrible in Summer league. Solid shooter for the bench but thats it.
17. Prince, Taurean - Great corner shooter, plays good defense. Rich man's Justin Holiday. Think someone throws money at him after all the games he started for LAL this year but you never know.
18. Samanic, Luka- 6'11, can move well, allegedly used to be able to shoot but shot 20% from 3 this year (EUGH). Hit 33% in the G league and has been a solid rebounder since Euroleague. Spurs got him in the first years ago for the upside that just hasn't materialized. A last resort backup big, but a big body that can move and score 20 PPG in the G-league feels like maybe Jay Huff Eastern Euro edition.
19. Stevens, Lamar - Big, strong, went to Penn State which is always a plus for Booth. Very solid defender, the main thing keeping him from being an NBA commodity is an inability to crack 32% from 3. If he could get 30-32% again like he was in 2022-2023, it would be serviceable enough for someone with his defense and he'd be Pwat/Holiday insurance as an 8th man in the playoffs. Probably available for a min after ending up on the Memphis scrap heap this year.
20. Thompson, Tristan - Pros: would supply the guys with steroids. Imagine Mike with dwight howard shoulders? He'd be a post scorer in no time. Tristan at this point is mainly a big body and a guy who could fit in the DAJ role but be a little more mobile and playable during the season.
21. Banton, Dalano - Imagine a G-league quality, tanking team Lebron James. Watching him tank command the end of season blazers was something else, but he did hit 36% of his 3s, score 18 ppg, rebound and pass well for the last 20 games of the season. Wouldn't hate to pick up Jamal's countryman, but Portland is likely going to pick up the team option unless they explode their roster (very possible given Brogdon is still blocking Scoot and Ayton looked alive for the end of the season. who knows what they do).
22. Robinson-Earl, Jeremiah - Former 5 star villanova recruit, Solid rotation big for OKC for years. Ended up in New Orleans riding the Pellies bench behind Zion/Ingram/Nance/Valanciunas. If they don't pick up his team option (They are going to be making big moves this summer to move Ingram and maybe CJ Mccollum), JRE could be a cap casualty. Always a solid shooter, having a 6'8 guy who can hit 34% from 3s, rebound with strength, guard bigs is a nice piece. Would be a solid stand in for Vlatko if the FO decides to move on from our favorite Slovenian.
23. Waters III, Lindy- Knockdown shooter who has never really gotten a fair look in OKC. One of their infinite draft picks stuck on the bench behind their young core. If they don't pick up his team option and look for upgrades, he'd be an interesting guy to give some run and see what he can do. Shot 44% from deep two different seasons in college, born in Boulder, 6'7 in shoes. Would be excited to see him as bench SG if CB moves into the starting lineup.

If you're still here, Congrats. You have made it to the good stuff. This is the list of guys I would be happy to have added to the Nuggets, and have a decent-high chance of being available for the right price.

**THE CREAM OF THE CROP**

1. Bitadze, Goga - I am Googoo for Goga puffs. Hopefully no one noticed, but while WCJ was out for a lot of the early season, Goga filled in seamlessly for the Magic. Accumulates tons of blocks, Offensive boards, able to finish around the rim with ease. Just keep him from shooting 3s. The best hooper from Georgia might be available on a cheap deal this summer as Orlando will prioritize outside shooting over size and WCJ/Mo Wagner appear to have locked up the 1/2 spots at center. Would love to see Goga in Denver, he could be a playoff caliber backup big from everything I've seen.
2. Drummond, Andre - The rebound king is a UFA. Many have mentioned him here, but Drummond always fills in well on any team as a backup big despite his shooting woes due to his control of the glass and defensive capabilities. His weakness has always been he is a legend in his mind, and thus tries things he has no business attempting. Head scratching euro-steps, behind the back transition dribbles out of bounds, contested floaters off the shot clock? All on the table. If Malone can bully him into playing a role, he would be a great pickup. The premier backup big available this summer.
3. Duke Jr., David (Two-Way) - The Klan chief is more of a depth pickup, but the all 1st team G-league player in 2023 has improved his outside shooting to 37% and maintains his slashing and defensive capabilities he showcased at Providence. Another guy that would be more of a depth/Two way pickup if we have to package some young guys to get off the zeke+Reggie contracts, but Duke has grown every year and looks like he could peak as a 6'5 3+D guard with bench lineups. Seems like a great long term investment if San Antonio uses their two way spots on this years picks.
4. Fultz, Markelle - Another odd man out in Orlando, Fultz still can't shoot 3s after his phantom shoulder issues... but has become a solid defender and midrange scorer as well as a fantastic POA defender off the bench. Always a playmaker, he could unlock Watson and Braun as a distributor as well as turn the switching bench defense into an iron curtain. Orlando has committed to Cole Anthony long term, loves Suggs, and just drafted Anthony Black. No one needs 4 PGs. If Fultz falls to the Nuggets, bench spacing would be an issue, but we would have an identity of defense and running in transition. Not sure who else is going to bid up for his services.
5. Goodwin, Jordan (Two-Way) - Goodwin first came onto my radar while watching him in DC as their backup guard in 22-23. He was an energy monster, getting steal after steal as a POA defender and diving all over the court. A poor man's Caruso/Kris Dunn, he is in the low 30s from 3 but is a willing passer and extremely strong defender. One of the better guard rebounders around, he was averaging 8(!!!) boards a game once he started getting minutes in Memphis end of season, which would be a huge help to the undersized bench unit. The only reason he isn't still in DC is Beal knew him from St Louis and demanded Goody be traded to Phoenix with him. Phx was signing a bunch of veterans to try to compete (lol) and Goodwin was a roster cut. Would be a great time to pick him up once Memphis makes some cuts as their 100 injuries this year heal. ""We have Alex Caruso at home"" type of player but I would love to see the havoc he could wreak at altitude.
6. Harris, Gary - Come home Gary. After getting 24 minutes per game in Orlando's rotation this past year, Gary might not be in high demand as his 3pt efficiency tumbled from 43% down to 37%. Injuries, as always, remain an issue, but Gary wouldn't be available for cheap if he was always healthy. As Orlando is one of the few teams with cap space focused on the big names this summer, they might not re-sign the UFA if they throw a bag of cash at PG/Klay/ect. They also drafted two guards last summer and likely want to see what the young guns can do.
7. Holiday, Aaron - Why not get another Holiday brother? The youngest Holiday managed to sneak into Houston's rotation this year, shooting 39% from deep and 92% from the line. The sharpshooting guard is solid on defense and would likely be an expensive bench piece or starter if God had made him 6'4 instead of 6'0. While undersized, Aaron would be a perfect second unit ballhandler and spacer, opening up the court for Denver's young wings to attack the rim.
8. Jackson, Quenton (Two-Way)- Athletic Freak. More of a depth pickup if we have to package Strawther or Watson to get off the Nnaji contract. A massive 6'5 PG with 40+ inches of bounce, Jackson flies around the court throwing dimes and outpacing teams. Would thrive at altitude and be a great distributor for all the young shooters Denver has drafted. Just don't ask him to take jumpshots. Would become the second best dunker after AG the moment he stepped in the building though.
9. Len, Alex - Massive body, great rebounder, has been running his ass off in Sacramento for two years backing up Sabonis. Don't think many teams are vying for his services and he would be a body to take some strain off Jokic against bad teams and in blowouts. Perfect vet min backup big.
10. Mamukelashvili, Sandro - Sandro Character Limit would be one of my top 3 picks on this list but he is an RFA and the spurs look like they might want to keep him and match any other offers. Big Mamu is a 6'11 tank that shoots 33% from deep for his career and battles for boards like his life depends on it. Would be a great 4/5 for depth if SA decides to spend some of their cap this summer to build around Wemby and still avoid luxury tax.
11. Morris, Monte - Needs no explanation. Come home. After being tossed around the league the last two years, Monte could likely be had for a vet min.
12. Plumlee, Mason - Mason is a known commodity in Denver, always able to run well, pass well, and rim protect. As long as he's not on the perimeter at the end of games (KMS), Money Mase would be a solid backup center to give Jokic some more time chilling on the bench. I imagine
13. Saric, Dario - Currently finishing a one year deal with GSW, Super Dario would bring great passing, size and shooting off the bench. A 37% 3 point shooter with slick passing and playoff experience from Philly and Phoenix, Dario would be an offensive weapon off the bench surrounded by athletic wings. Would really elevate what we could do offensively given he can space for the young wings and distribute the ball well from the mid and low post. One of my 3 top big men signing possibilities for us.
14. Smith Jr., Dennis - Athletic Freak and ball of energy, DSJ has had a resurgence since leaving Dallas and Detroit. A career 30% 3 point shooter, DSJ is best used as a penetrate and kick energy weapon off the bench. After having his most efficient season ever (low bar to be fair), he is looking like a solid playmaker and court general for bench units. He can be had for cheap and would be a clear upgrade over Reggie at Backup PG. Also he hates Dallas, and goes 110% against them every game. Given how the West looks right now, that could come in handy.
15. Theis, Daniel - Another Clippers backup big, Thies anchored the German defense that won the FIBA World Cup last summer. He shoots 35% from 3, is switchable on defense at a mobile 6'8 250, and would be another solid backup big signing for the Nuggets. Played in 40+ playoff games with Boston and was a rotation player in all of them, so he's prepared and experienced in the Postseason.
16. Tillman, Xavier - The ex-Grizzly filled in admirably last postseason after Brandon Clarke and Steven Adams both got season ending injuries in the final month of the season. He had a 22-13 game against AD to win the Grizzlies a playoff game (what backup big on Denver is capable of this??) and has been a solid bench big his entire career. Boston traded for him at the break for KP insurance and it wouldn't be a terrible idea to pick up Tillman on a minimum as a 2nd/3rd string big. Mobile at 6'8 250, he would be a solid fit with our ""Guard and Run"" style bench.
17. Walker IV, Lonnie- Lonnie won the Lakers a playoff game over Golden State just last year and everyone forgot because they hit the Denver buzzsaw next round. On a 1 year minimum in Brooklyn, Lonnie put together a solid season off the bench. 38% from 3, decent defense, explosive athleticism, Lonnie could be a ballhandler and spacer on the second unit.
18. Wright, Delon - I have loved Delon's game for years. He is perpetually undervalued. Massive guard with great POA defense and decent shooting, he can slot into any lineup Denver runs. He can bring the ball up, shoot reliably, and playmake without turning the ball over. Defending the other teams best guard in almost every stop he's been at, the 6'5 PG has been one of the top guards in the NBA at steals rates at every stop. At 35% from 3, delon also can't be left alone on the perimeter and would slot into the backup point guard spot with ease. The only issue is injuries, but he wouldn't be searching for vet min deals if he was healthy all the time. He got his last big contract with DC two years ago, and I think he could be had on a 1 year deal if he slips through the cracks. Top 3 option for me.
19. Fournier, Evan -Don't Google was a sharpshooter and scorer with value at every stop in the NBA before a disastrous stint in his second season in New York. After being a 40% 3 point shooter with decent defense scoring 15-20 a game, Fournier got buried on the bench in New York behind Josh Hart and Quentin Grimes and never resurfaced. He got exiled to Detroit in the middle of last year and played terribly. Every time the French national team plays, Fournier shows himself to be a quality player, so Olympic success this summer could sink hopes of getting him for cheap. If not though... a solid scorer and reliable volume shooter off the bench is just what Denver needs.
20. Green, Jeff - The return of Uncle Jeff is very possible if Houston doesn't pick up his 8 Million team option this summer. Not sure about their long term plans but if they extend Jalen Green and Sengun this summer, Uncle Jeff could be on his way out of Houston. Why not return to the only place he's won out of his myriad stops?

If you're counting, there's one FA left unaccounted for. This guy has the same upside as Wemby and there will be a feeding frenzy for his services this summer as the potential best player in the league, so he gets his own category.

1. Bol Bol - Lol. Lmao even.

8,How nice would it have been to have Hartenstein in this series?,"Just a fun thought exercise. Thinking he’d give us a lot more lineup flexibility with his size, good passing skills, and him grabbing us some boards wouldn’t hurt. Say if Holiday or Reggie are throwing up bricks IHart can get some min to matchup against Naz. To be clear I know we won a chip and I love watching the Knicks so I wouldn’t change a thing. "

15,Calvin Booth on Bones trade,"Nuggets general manager Calvin Booth explains why he traded Bones Hyland 

“I knew you couldn’t have two guys that couldn’t guard, and we couldn’t have two guys that were young and kind of more ‘me guys.’ Mike makes $30 million. He’s one of the best shooters in the NBA. So, Bones, there’s no place for you.”"
16,Calvin Booth says he sees DaRon Holmes II as a four moving forward. Interesting to hear him kind of indirectly push back on the idea Holmes is set to be Nikola Jokic's backup.,
17,In Defense of Calvin Booth,"I’ll preface by asking for forgiveness, since I’m a convert from NFL backseat GMing and I’m probably about to expose myself for knowing absolutely nothing about NBA roster-building. But for as dire as things seem for the Nuggets right now, I’m not totally opposed to the moves. 

[This article from the Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2024/5/21/24161611/denver-nuggets-offseason-2024-calvin-booth-michael-malone) published after our playoff elimination seemed to do a pretty good job summing up our 2023-24 difficulties: we’ve failed to fully develop our last several years of draft talent, arguably through a lack of meaningful playing time, and put extra pressure on our starters and veteran backups to compensate. These Booth moves seem to indicate a desire to reverse course on that trend, especially as we butt up against the budget for veteran free agents. We made an aggressive move to obtain a young player who should be able to contribute to scoring, we shipped off a reliable vet backup, and we look poised to lose another vet and member of our championship starting roster in KCP. Booth is telling Malone that we’re playing your young guys whether he wants to or not. 

Truthfully, as long as Malone acquiesces, I think this roster can avoid serious deterioration. Braun should probably earn a starting roster spot this year and do a reasonably good job replacing KCP’s defensive production. They probably expect Daron Holmes to fill in for Reggie as a rotational offensive piece, and I sort of expect that they’ll use whatever money is left over from not retaining KCP to bring in some more reliable depth pieces. 

It certainly hasn’t been a pretty offseason, and the Reggie + picks trade still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. But it doesn’t feel like we’re cleaning house, so much as betting on the idea that we still have all the pieces we need to stay competitive at the highest level. Curious for thoughts from other people who probably/definitely have more knowledge on this topic than me."
18,Calvin Booth needs to sign G Yabusele from France.....,......big man off the bench with NBA chops
19,Calvin Booth took 2 1sts and 3 2nd rounders and turned it into... Julian Strawther?,"Ya'll spent most of last season making fun of Tim Connelly but he're the reality... every move he has made outside of the Gibert trade has been gold for the Wolves. And while the Rudy trade was a clear-cut overpayment, he is being proven right that Towns and Gobert can work.

He also had the KCP trade lined up before leaving town. I was told by a Nuggets reporter we all trust that trade was happening during the Avs Stanley Cup run. Aka well before Booth took over.

So while Booth derserves mad credit for the Bruan selection and for the Brown signing (and Bruce has alluded to him not being the Nuggets first option last offseason), I've always felt Booth got a bit too much credit for our run last year. Because if Mal had been healthy in 2021 or 2022, we very well may have had a ring before then.

Meanwhile, Booth has mortgaged nearly every trade asset we have for the following return...

Thomas Bryant (no longer on the team)

Julian Picket (an undersized 24 year old with zero ability to get to the rim or create his own shot)

Kamagate (tbd but as of now, he does not look like an NBA player)

Watson (was a reach based on the idea he could develop offensively but has shown zero growth on that end)

Strawther (who I think is gonna be a player but who had huge question marks about his ability to play defense in the NBA and has been getting shredded on that end)

Now, I expected to get downvoted to all hell, but I think the conversation is woth having. Because we have very few ways of upgrading the roster. All of the chips are pushed in on kids who, outside of Julien, were drafted ahead of where they were expected to go).

And as of right now, none of those kids look ready to contibute. And we failed to cash in our title on any FA agent signings better than RJ and a completely washed Holiday.

And the team has looked worse is this recent stretch than they did at any point without Murray in 2022."
20,Calvin Booth is the Tyreke Evans of general managers,"Do you guys remember Tyreke Evans? Averaged 20/5/5 as a rookie and won Rookie of the Year in a class with Steph Curry, James Harden, DeRozan, Brandon Jennings and Jrue Holiday. Then he dropped of hard and got banned from the league. 

That's the trajectory Calvin Booth is on. His first summer in charge was the most impeccable piece of fron office work you could have. Drafted CB. Salary dumped JG for 1 first and got back the pick that became PWat.Traded for KCP and Ish Smith. Signed Bruce Brown. 11/10 no notes. 

As soon as the trade deadline, cracks started to show. Dealt away Bones for just two seconds. Somehow traded 3 2nds for Thomas Bryant who played 0 minutes in the playoffs. During the title defense season, he executed a great trade with the Thunder, sending out the 2029 1st for two seconds and a 1st. 

Then the wheels fell off he sent that future pick away for a pick in 2023. That was a mistake. Denver didn't need 3 rookies, this past season showed that. Plus all the picks Denver made were considered reaches. They could have stayed put at 37 and still taken Strawther. Jalen Pickett would have been available at 40, the original pick. 

He gave Reggie a 2 year - $10 mil deal for no reason. His $3.8 mil non-bird rights would have been plenty. No one was competing with the nuggets. Zeke was extended. Absolutely stupid at the time, even more so now. Justin Holiday it was a great signing and must be acknowledged. Ultimately, the season came down to the other max guys shitting the bed against Minnesota. Denver had enough to win. But last seasons mistakes are coming back to bite them this year and that might affect the team. 

KCP walked because the nuggets don't want to go over the second apron. They wouldn't have been in that position if they didn't have Zeke's salary on the books. Reggie was salary dumped for 3 seconds. Wouldn't have been the case if he got his going rate last year instead of the dumb contract Booth handed him. Even the salary dumb was boneheaded. 3 2nds to get off a $5 mil contract? Mavs just paid the same price to dump a $16 mil contract AND got a young 3&D player back. What was stopping Booth for making that exact trade? Jackson and 3 2nds for Grimes. Would have been a decent kcp replacement. 

I won't kill the Holmes pick, although we know Malone won't play him. Saric was a good signing. At least there's that. But since the summer of 2022, Denver is making wrong decisions, which are compounding to close the title window for this team. Denver still has a great 7 man rotation and if Strawther hits and Denver finds a backup PG somewhere, still the favorite in the West in my opinion. But boy this is could have and should have been a lot easier."

Not really sure why he signed Justin Holiday considering ppl like Oubre jr were available. The   
 4 'vets' he has on the bench are Holiday, DJ, Zeke and Reggie. Only Reggie deserves regular minutes the odd brain freeze notwithstanding. 

The bench should not look terrible every time one of the starters is hurt. NO has a couple of guys out but their bench looks fine.

24,Our ownership cheaping out on matching the Wolves offer to Tim looks horrible in retrospect. Or why Calvin Booth is a busrider.,"Adam Mares finally publically acknowledged what  he told me a full two months before Tim left while watching the Avs at DNVR.

The foundation of the KCP trade (Morris + Barton) was a done deal at the trade deadline of the 22' season. The reason it didn't happen is because Jamal decided against coming back-- at which point keeping Monte was necessary and the teams decided to do the deal over the summer instead.

Booth got all the credit for that deal-- because not many people knew that it had been a done deal for months. And he deserves credit for hitting the send button and then extending KCP. And obviously for the Bruce Brown signing.

However, almost every move he has made since then has been a disaster.

Everyone knew lasts summer's FA class for PGs was barren yet we didn't prioritize finding a replacement for Bones when we traded him. Instead, we burned 3 seconds trading for Thomas Byrant. A guy who was never going to be able to play in the playoffs and who was set to be a FA.

Then Booth traded a lightly protected 29' first for a shotgun approach to a part of the draft that is very hit or miss and decides to burn #32 on a 24 year old PG who relied on backing down younger, smaller players in college and despite championship equity, walks out of FA with Reggie Jackson and Holiday-- two guys who were 3 years washed. 

Then he has the audacity to tell KOC that Watson (who was the primary return for burning a 27 1st) is already better than Bruce Brown and to indicate that the approach to the offseason was taken, in part, to ensure the youth saw the floor.

At the time, I understood the logic of aiming for youth and cheap contracts but got downvoted in oblivion for arguing that a) we should have been aiming at 2nd draft guys instead of solely stockpiling late picks and b) stating that you should always be aiming for as much talent as possible, not limiting your options by aiming for guys who are okay being bench warmers.

Obi Toppin, NAW, Jalen Smith, Issaih Joe are all examples of 2nd draft guys contributing in the playoffs right now.

Derrick Jones Jr and Dante Exum are examples of guys on minimums who are contributing positively. And that's the bare minimum, not the TPMLE we gave RJ. 

And where as Tim regularly found 2 way guys who turned into NBA players (Torrey Craig, Hatenstein, Kedrick Williams, Dozier before the ACL tear), we have yet to have a 2 way signed by Booth (CG was also Tim) contribute.

All of that added up to a team whose bench was a disaster. No backup center meant Jokic carrying a heavy burden. RJ being predictably awful meant Murray couldn't be load managed because the team was the worst they've ever been without him. Gordon was forced to play way too many minutes- including at backup center.

And now all of the starters are worn to a pulp and mentally exhausted because of it.

Braun and Watson both have potential. But Watson is unplayable on offense and Braun is still a net negative on that end when the playoffs hit and teams stop guarding him. Strawther and Tyson both have potential but we've basically hedged all of our assets on Watson, Strawther, Tyson, Pickett (not a believer) and the 7 footer they sold for cash considerations... and as of now, none of them look like sure things.

Oh and KCP (as much as he struggles with the Wolves matchup) has a player option. And RJ and Pickett are on guaranteed deals so upgrading the backup point guard is going to be tough.

Contrast that with Tim building a team that doesn't have a single bad player in the rotation. His draft picks (and I'm high on the kid they took in the 2nd round) sit marinating while NAW, Monte, Conley, Ried (signed to a steal of an extention) and Kyle Anderson help build out the deepest team in the NBA.

Yes, he gave up to much for Rudy. He was also right it would work and right that ANT was ready (and had them on a clock).

And the Kroenke's were idiots for letting a top 3 GM walk from his contract and praying an unproven GM could hit the ground running during a title window. Not only because it's likely cut the Nuggets window short but also because it allowed Tim to customize a team designed to wreck the Nuggets.

"
25,Remember when I said Tim Connelly is so much better than Calvin Booth and this sub roasted me?,"Now you see the genius Tim Connelly who built 80% of the Nuggets championship team then how Tim Connelly built a team in 2 years to counter his championship Nuggets team.

Calvin Booth is a bum, tell me why the fuck he isn't? He didn't get us a backup PG, PF, and a C and now our players are getting gassed.

Tim Connelly drafted Jaden McDaniels and pays him $4 million a year who turns out to be a steal while Calvin Booth pays that bum Zeke Nnaji and pays him $8 million a year.

We are not going to win a championship unless massive changes happens in our lineup. Teams adapts, improves, and gets better.

If we get sweeped by the Wolves, I just thope they fire Calvin Booth. If you still defend him, you are not a Nuggets fan. Stop being overly positive and complacent.

Actually, you know what? Fuck it. Getting swept probably means there would be a massive reconstruction in our roster and we might finally get a competent manager."
26,Calvin Booth,
27,Calvin Booth realising what he’s cooked drafting CB and PWAT,
28,What can Calvin Booth do?,"Sign CP3 with 5m/year and drop RJ?
Sign Kevin Love with 5m/year and drop DAJ?
Drop KCP and Let Braun start. 
Then our salary will fall below 1st apron and we can sign Bruce Brown with the that extra MLE (13m) if his team option isnt exercised? 

Most importantly, trade MPJ? 


One thing is for certain—- do not overuse Jokic anymore"

33,Give it a break,"The overreactions from this fan base are ridiculous. We have a bad playoff run (that still could’ve very easily gone our way) and y’all are ready to blow up the core? Good grief. Tired of seeing trade MPJ, Murray or X core player. We are still a damn good team. Do we need to tweak the edges? Yes. We need scoring off of our bench. CB is a GREAT defensive player, however, he looks timid on offense a lot of times. And he will be more comfortable with time. Same goes with P Wat. However, when we are relying on Reggie Jackson to provide the scoring off of our bench we have an issue. If y’all want to talk about moving on from people let’s start with Nnaji who still hasn’t been able to crack the rotation in a real way. Or Vlatko who has not had a memorable moment for this team in idk how long. But when it comes to the core give this team a break. We have a bunch of fair weather fans in this fan base, and if that’s what y’all want to be then please go be a fan of whoever wins the ship every year.

P.S. Calvin Booth should be under more fire for the bench he put together to defend a title than the players should."
34,[Lowe] The Denver Nuggets and the convenient fear of the second apron,">The Nuggets can contend for titles as long as Jamal Murray and the world's best player are healthy, but the downgrade from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to Christian Braun will show itself against the best teams in the playoffs. There is also the backup-to-the-backup problem; someone outside Denver's rotation now has to fill Braun's reserve role -- just as the Nuggets scrambled to fill Bruce Brown's minutes last season.

>Braun is a solid, improving role player who can guard up in size better than Caldwell-Pope. But he is not yet in Caldwell-Pope's universe as a shooter, and shooting is what Denver needs most from that spot. They already attempted the fewest 3s in the league last season, and even for a team built around Jokic there is a math threshold you have to hit.

>The Nuggets will blame the apron, and there is some truth to the idea that the apron is a convenient scapegoat for owners who don't want to spend. A running joke around the NBA is that ""no owner wants to be called cheap at the country club.""

>Matching the Magic's three-year, $66 million offer for Caldwell-Pope could have -- could have -- set the Nuggets up for three straight years above the second apron. Escaping the second apron is hard. The league removes a lot of roster-building tools. You can reduce your salary only in trades, and it might become harder to dump money as more teams approach the aprons. You might end up stuck with the players you have and (in Denver's case) paying enormous repeater tax bills.

>The counter, of course, is that being ""stuck"" with a championship-level roster is the whole point of owning an NBA team. The Nuggets also could have ducked the second apron this season by salary dumping Zeke Nnaji, though teams with space would have squeezed Denver for draft picks. The Nuggets are already out several future picks, so they are running low on ammo to grease the wheels on apron-related dumps.

>Ducking the second apron in either the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons with Caldwell-Pope on the books would have been damned near impossible without sloughing away a major salary along the way -- plus perhaps another role player in addition to Nnaji. Even without Caldwell-Pope, the Nuggets could be in danger of exceeding the second apron in 2026-27 given potential new deals for Murray, Aaron Gordon, Braun and Peyton Watson.

>There were plausible ways to evading the second apron this season, keeping Caldwell-Pope and putting off painful choices one year. Those pathways were tight. But it was possible, and there is some merit to absorbing the penalties and paying through the nose to maintain a team you know could win the title.

>There is also merit to Nuggets GM Calvin Booth arguing this situation is precisely the reason you draft players you think could help soon: Braun, Watson, Julian Strawther, Jalen Pickett, Hunter Tyson and now DaRon Holmes II. (Any GM parroting that argument is surely aware it gives cover to their bosses.)

>Booth is intensely proud of his draft record. Those players had better be ready. Strawther looked ready before injuries short-circuited his season. He should be a good fit buzzing around Jokic.

>Bottom line: The second apron is both a real impediment and something that stirs preexisting frugality.

>Back in 2018, I wrote about the moral dilemmas of the new supermax contract -- how some teams faced painful choices between paying stars gigantic, ever-rising contracts into their 30s, or trading them away. Had the NBA (and its team governors) accidentally introduced another wrinkle cutting against roster continuity?

>With the help of several executives, I proposed a bunch of rule changes (some realistic, some pie in the sky) designed to mitigate the financial pain of keeping teams together: amnesty clauses, bonus cap exceptions, other minutia. The most relevant: What if supermax deals for homegrown players didn't count in their entirety for luxury tax purposes? Even if that merely saved billionaires some scratch, was that worth it to help great teams stick together?

>It feels like there is room to discuss something like that in conjunction with the second apron."

# Overall Outlook

While the roster situation is in a relatively great place for the Nuggets moving forward, Calvin Booth and the Denver front office face some challenges this offseason if they want to make a significant improvement to their team after coming up just short in the second round this year. The challenges begin with KCP and his player option for $15.4 million. With teams like Detroit, Orlando, Philly, and Toronto all having cap space, the Nuggets might face a nightmare scenario where another team drives up the price on the 31-year-old 3-and-D player, who will surely be looking for a long-term payday. At the minimum he will get offered a 4-year deal using the MLE, which Denver can easily match with bird rights, but there could be a team that wants to give him a Bruce Brown type deal, which could make Calvin Booth hesitate.

With that being said, the next challenge to discuss is the second apron. With current projections, bringing KCP back will almost certainly put Denver over the newly created second apron which will be in full effect from here on out with its penalties. The front office is going to have to decide if enduring those penalties is worth keeping their expensive starting five together moving forward. Let's go over the second apron penalties to try to make sense of the situation ourselves.

* Loss of the Mid-Level Exception, so only minimum contracts can be used to sign free agents
* Cannot bring in more salary than is sent out in a trade
* Cannot send more than one player out in a single trade
* The team's 1st round pick seven years out becomes ""frozen"", or untradeable. This takes effect only if the team finishes the season over the apron. The 2032 draft is the first draft that would be affected
* If the team finishes over the second apron 3 years out of 5 then that frozen draft pick is automatically moved to the end of the first round, regardless of team record that season

There are a couple other smaller restrictions involving things like trade exceptions and trading cash, but those 5 are the main reasons to consider why a team like the Nuggets would possibly lower their salary to avoid the second apron.

Let's play out a scenario where Reggie Jackson picks up his player option and KCP opts out to re-sign in Denver on a 4-year deal that starts at $17.5 million. The front office could fill out their roster with the two draft picks that they own this June and end up right around $6.5 million over the second apron. They could then attach 2-3 second rounders to Zeke Nnaji to convince a rebuilding team to take his contract off the books and replace him with a veteran minimum free agent signing.

|second apron line|$189,486,000|
|room below second apron|$121,736|
|luxury tax bill|$38,660,108|

That would be just enough for them to dip below the apron, however, it wouldn't solve their problems entirely.  Being right up against the second apron and treating it as a hard cap means you can't add any significant salary, so they still can't functionally use the MLE or bring in more salary than they send out in a trade. They also will not have made any sort of significant upgrade to their roster in this scenario, and while the roster might not need upgrading, some fans will undoubtably want some reason to believe why next season will be more like 2023 than this past one.

The uncomfortable reality for Denver at the moment is that if they do want to make a significant addition to their team this summer, they will almost certainly have to either let KCP walk or trade one of their other starters. And if KCP is brought back on a deal that starts at higher than $20 million, then they will almost certainly have to trade a starter to avoid the second apron, even if they were able to move Nnaji. We know Jokic and Murray are off the table and Gordon is more valuable to Denver than he would be to any other team, so he is probably not getting moved this summer. MPJ and his $35.9 million would likely be the choice by default for either matching salary or dumping salary in a potential trade.

While they aren't loaded with draft capital, Denver does have 2 first round picks, 6 second round picks, and 3 swaps available to trade this summer which they could attach to MPJ and create an attractive package that could potentially bring back a player that is both better on the court and cheaper on the books. That isn't going to be easy task, as players better and cheaper than MPJ aren't usually found on the trade market, but every summer we see players become available who we didn't expect to be just months prior.

Another piece of business for the Nuggets this summer is to extend Jamal Murray, who is set to be an unrestricted free agent in 2025. The expectation is that they will offer him a standard max contract that starts at 30% of the cap and has 8% raises. Things could be complicated by Murray making an all-NBA team next season which would boost the salary to 35% of the cap, but that seems doubtful at the moment. Overall, this should be an exciting move for Denver since they will be locking down the second most important part of their team long-term, but it should be a reminder that the roster is only going to get more expensive. Aaron Gordon has a player option for 2025-2026 and will no doubt be opting out of that for higher pay on a new long-term contract. Even if the front office can manage to maneuver their way below the second apron for 2024-2025, there is no feasible way to do so for 2025-2026 while keeping their starting five together.

The luxury tax bill is another challenge that the franchise faces, although with some of the wealthiest ownership in the league, they should be able to face this challenge with deep pockets. I try to be as realistic as possible when predicting what an ownership group will be willing to pay in luxury tax by looking at both their current level of wealth as well as their eagerness to pay the tax in the past. The Kroenkes are some of the richest owners in sports, however, they we haven't seen them pay more than $22 million in tax in any given year, so we can't say for sure if they would be willing to pay the $40+ million that it would take to be a second apron team next season. Let's hope that if Denver does decide to move a starter this summer to lower the salary bill, it is because the front office wants to avoid the apron penalties and not because ownership is cheaping out.

# Summary

The 2023 NBA champions have some tough decisions to make this June/July as they try to get back to the top of the league. They have to decide if going into the new second apron is worth keeping this championship core together for another year or if it would be smarter to try to pivot this offseason and shake up the supporting cast around Jokic, Murray, and Gordon. Letting KCP walk or trading MPJ would drop their salary bill well below the second apron and keep their roster building flexibility open, but it would also leave a big hole in the starting lineup. If they do decide that going over the apron is worth it, they are likely going to have to use Zeke Nnaji as matching salary to bring back a player making less than $8.9 million to bolster their bench. They could also salary dump Nnaji to dip below the apron if they are able to re-sign KCP at a low enough cost, but they won't be able to add salary during the season in that case.

So, what do you think the front office should do? Is keeping the championship core together worth the second apron restrictions? Will KCP be lured away to another team with a big payday? Is trading Michael Porter Jr the solution to getting ahead of their financial troubles? Let me know in the comments and thanks for reading!

38,Julian Strawther,
39,nuggets twitter cooking rn,Calvin Booth please save us from going crazy 😭
40,"Sasha Vezenkov (the greatest shooter in Euroleague) is asking to be traded out, get rid of Zeke and put him in Denver.","His no-dribble 3 point shooting and Jokic's no-look pass is a match made in heaven.

If anyone in this sub has connections to Josh Kroenke, Calvin Booth, or Michael Malone. Please let them know, this guy is the perfect match for Jokic, Jokic seriously needs a good shooter to help him."
41,Was Tyus Jones never an option for Denver?,"The Nuggets were in desperate need of a point guard, which is why they went for Westbrook. But Tyus Jones is such a better fit. He's a much more cerebral basketball player, would desperately give the Nuggets the playmaker they need and is a much better shooter. Last year, he shot 41% from 3 on 4 attempts per a game while also averaging a 7 to 1 Assist/Turnover Ratio. Westbrook, on the other hand, is known for horrible turnovers and non-existent spacing.

This seems to be another huge fumble by Calvin Booth."
42,We don’t need a backup center,"The Nuggets have had plenty of options on the team and on the free agent market to stick in at the backup center position and none on them have/will solve our bench problems. What we need is a backup point guard. Someone to set the table for everyone else but who can also score when needed, especially in PnR. Reggie was great to start the season but has severely fallen off (hoping for Big Govmnt to show up for the playoffs though). The other young Nuggets definitely aren’t ready to step into a floor general role and the little we saw from Pickett was not great (hoping his development is progressing well but usually in the NBA no news isn’t good news).

With that in mind…. Who would be a good point guard selection for the Nuggets in the upcoming draft?? As a Buffs fan I am biased but KJ Simpson would be an absolute steal in the 2nd round. He may be on the short side but he’s a good defender (better than Monte at least), a GREAT rebounder, a veteran leader, and insane competitor. He averaged +50/40/90 shooting this past season with 20 points, 5 assists, and 6 rebounds per game. He can score from anywhere but is always looking to get his teammates involved. He checks all the boxes on Calvin Booth’s player characteristics list and is currently projected to go in the 2nd round if he declares. 

So, what do yall think? 
"
43,First SL Game Grades,"#A-grades:

**Trey Alexander** - Yeah he’s the only one earning an A and mostly because grades are relative to expectations. He showed as much as anyone on the court today, looked like he could eventually crack a rotation. 

#B-grades:

**DaRon Holmes** - Nothing truly special like we saw some other potential Nuggets like Terrence Shannon or Ajay Mitchell, but did a lot of what he was supposed to do and hit some 3s, a solid first outing, now let’s hope he’s healthy. 

Edit: damn

**Julian Strawther** - I had as hard a time grading Strawther as the play-by-play guy had saying his name correctly. He had some shining moments and rebounded well, but was sloppy with the ball, and, contrary to some Nuggets fans’ opinions, doesn’t look like a primary or secondary ball handler at any point in his future. 

#C-grades 

**PJ Hall** - Expectations weren’t too high for Hall, he was pretty much what I expected. He’s fine, but has a long way to go before ever playing NBA minutes. 

**Hunter Tyson** - Early in the game, I thought this might be the Hunter Tyson breakout. Turns out he’s a chucker, which is nice when the ball goes in the hoop. Left a lot to be desired on the court, especially defensively. 

#D-grades

**The Cardio Guys** - Gabe McGlothan, Jahmir Young, and Au’Diese Toney combined for 28 minutes, 0 points, 0 FGs attempted, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists. McGlothan and Young led the team in +/- which is something I guess. And Toney put up 0’s across the board except personal fouls and turnovers. Finally, an NBA stat line I can achieve. 

#F-grades

**Jalen Pickett** - He was bad. Very bad. Is this part of the plan for backup PG? He made me wish we never traded Reggie. I’m not sure he does a single thing at the NBA level or ever will. I’d cut him tomorrow, an empty roster spot is more valuable. 

**Calvin Booth** - Adding an overpaid Dario Saric, letting your elite 3/D SG walk in free agency, and planning to replace him with guys currently on the roster is a borderline fireable. Even if Braun can fill the role, your bench is far weaker because of it. At least we still have Zeke Nnaji making $8M to save the day or something. 

"
44,Interesting...,"Out of all the possible late first round targets, Daron Holmes II is the most intriguing fit to this current roster. The fact he has a late first round promise adds even more interest to whether Calvin Booth could draft our backup PF/C PF the future."
45,malstroem's 2024 Denver Nuggets Draft Day Guide,"Hello this is your friend malstroem. You might remember me from the [draft day guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/14ed8p6/malstroems_denver_nuggets_draft_day_guide/) I made last year. I enjoy following the draft process every year a lot. Since the draft is happening next week, I have decided to make a Nuggets draft day guide for people who might not follow the draft process as much (but if you do follow the draft process a lot you are still welcome to read!). THE DRAFT IS NEXT WEEK ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY GUYS. So I guess here it is lol

#What needs do the Denver Nuggets have coming into the draft?

Well this year is easier than last time. The Denver Nuggets have a big need for a backup point guard and a backup center to start. Reggie Jackson has a player option to return next year, which he is likely to exercise. Regardless of this, backup point guard is still a priority as he was not able to contribute much during the playoffs, only being able to play for 3-4 minute stretches at a time providing well below average play. The other point guard currently on the roster is 2023 second round pick Jalen Pickett. Collin Gillespie is set to be a restricted free agent this offseason. Pickett was only able to play 122 minutes total over 27 games this season and looked a bit out of his league. Gillespie was on a two way contract, and he managed to play almost twice as many minutes, with  225 minutes total over 24 games. He looked serviceable at times, but he is still quite unproven at the NBA level, not to mention it's unlikely he gets a full roster spot with Jackson and Pickett set to be on the roster for next year.

At the backup center position, Denver has Zeke Nnaji on contract for next year, who signed a 4 year 32 million dollar extension just this season. After 4 years of disappointments on the Nuggets roster, I think it is safe to say Zeke Nnaji is not the answer at backup center and the team should be looking to move him on the trade market, especially considering he has a relatively large salary to be able to match for potential incoming players. DeAndre Jordan is also set to become an unrestricted free agent, and even if Denver were to bring him back for his leadership role, it is pretty clear at his soon to be 36 years of age he is not able to provide a consistent 10-15 minute option for the team.

There is also the KCP question. He has a player option to return for next season, which he is likely to decline as he searches for a higher value, longer term deal. The Denver Nuggets have his bird rights, which means they can offer him any amount of money and match any contract offer he might receive from other teams around the league, so it doesn't mean he is gone for sure, but it does have big implications regarding the 2nd salary apron of the new CBA. I am not an expert on the financial shit, but to put it in a simple way, if the Nuggets bring KCP back they will 100% be above the 2nd apron which means they can't sign players for more than the veteran minimum, they don't get a mid level exception during the offseason and they can't aggregate different players for a trade, among other things. If the KCP does not come back, the Nuggets could try to make other moves to get under the 2nd apron and try to gain access to these perks mentioned previously. KCP's deadline to opt in or out of his contract for next year is on June 29th, so Denver is unlikely to know with 100% certainty what the roster situation is regarding that before the draft starts, but they should have an idea of what's going on. If KCP walks away, wing could be a need for the Nuggets, though still less of a need considering they can slot Christian Braun into the starting lineup while still having 2023 first round pick Julian Strawther and 2022 first round pick Peyton Watson as bench wing options. They could also very likely target someone in the trade market who could come here and replace KCP as the 2 guard in the starting lineup, or at the very least someone who is able to play 6th man minutes.

Other than that, from a pure roster perspective, most of the team seems to be locked for next year. 4 starters are coming back for sure, and the only way a big roster scramble would happen is if the team decided to deal Michael Porter Jr in the trade market, which I think would be extremely unlikely as of now.

From a more basketball perspective, after these past playoffs, I think it is sure to say the Nuggets need better offensive players, guys who are able to create for themselves and for others, as only Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon (the latter mostly as part time) were able to do so during the playoffs, and probably more guys who are able to shoot the ball at above average rates. There's also the eternal backup big question, ideally the Nuggets would want someone whom with they can replicate at least a bit of the offense they play with Nikola Jokic on the floor, which means someone who reads the floor well and is able to pass at a decent level, especially out of DHO actions, but they have targeted plenty of players outside of this particular archetype in the past.


#What assets do the Nuggets have coming into the draft?

The Denver Nuggets currently own the 28th pick in the 2024 NBA draft, and the 56th pick in the 2024 NBA draft.

#Is there any chance the Nuggets make a deal to move up, or down, or out of the draft?

The Denver Nuggets are considered a 2nd apron team as of now, so like I said they are quite limited in terms of moves they could possibly make. I would not expect to see a deal to try to move up in the 1st round at all, but I think it is quite likely they try to move up in the 2nd round from 56th overall. Usually moving up in the 2nd round tends to be quite easy and cheap and it is something the Nuggets have been willing to do in recent years, making deals to move up from their original 2nd round spots in both of the drafts Calvin Booth has been in charge of. Possible trade partners would include Indiana at 36th, 49th and 50th, Portland at 34th and 40th, Charlotte at 42nd, Washington at 51st, among others. It's hard to predict anything cause the 2nd round starts getting crazy with all the moves that usually happen, and probably more so this year as the draft has been extended to a 2 day event. I'd personally expect the Nuggets to pick at 28th, and probably to pick somewhere in the 2nd round, consistent with Calvin Booth's ""build through the draft"" philosophy so far.

#That's cool but I don't really care about all of this. I just wanna know who the hell are we considering and potentially picking. GIMME THE DAMN NAMES OF THE PLAYERS!

Yes. I will be dividing prospects by draft range based on what we know and what we have know (late first round, mid second round and later) and by position. I will provide a brief scouting report, and availability rating based on how likely I think it is for a certain prospect to be available at that range, and I'll try to explain why I think a prospect might be a good fit or a bad fit with the Nuggets. I will also provide a big board ranking, which won't be my own to try keep it as unbiased as possible, but based on Tankathon's big board and ESPN's Jonathan Givony and Jeremy Woo's big board. Let's get started!

#Guards in the late first round range

#Tyler Kolek, Marquette, 6'2, 197 lbs, 23 years old, 24th on Tankathon, 26th on ESPN

If you like old school, hard-nosed point guards, you probably like Tyler Kolek a lot. A 4 year college player, he is one of the best playmakers in this draft class. He excels at making others shine, can play both in a PNR based offense but also on a motion based offense. Amazing feel for the game and floor reading ability, while also being able to limit turnovers.  He shoots the ball from deep well, averaged 40% and 39% from 3 in his last two seasons at college, though at a bit lower volume on 3.1 and 3.0 attempts per game respectively. Has a good floater game and was able to finish at the rim well at the college level, but probably won't be his calling card at the NBA. One of those guys who plays at 110% energy every time he steps on the court. Not a good athlete, though not a horrible one either. Has good defensive fundamentals and feel, and is able to play the passing lanes well, but doesn't project as an above average NBA defender. Will get into trouble with non small guards but will probably be able to survive due to effort and fundamentals.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** I would say good but there are some drawbacks. First of course he doesn't have the size/length or the athleticism that the Nuggets have looked for and prioritized during the Calvin Booth administration. I would also say he is better as a PNR guard (Nuggets play among the least amount of PNR possessions in the league) but he is also competent in a motion based offense. Marquette ran a lot of  DHO concepts that are familiar to what you see with the Nuggets. But aside from that he is as ready to contribute as you're gonna get this year. He reminds me somewhat to Monte Morris, but Kolek is probably a bit more dynamic. Not much upside to him, but you can trust him to play 15-20 minutes right off the bat.

**Availability Rating:** Low. There's a lot of noise about Phoenix liking him a lot at 22. If you ask me there's a decent chance he goes higher than that, as high as 15th to Miami. Other potential landing spots could be Milwaukee at 23, New York at 24/25 and Minnesota at 27th. I do not think it's likely he's available at 28th, but it wouldn't be that crazy either.

#Carlton ""Bub"" Carrington, Pittsburgh, 6'5, 195 lbs, 18 years old, 31st on Tankathon, 20th on ESPN

A top 3 name in the draft and one of the youngest players in the draft, Bub Carrington is a big sized guard with good feel for the game who has shown great flashes of self creation scoring and shooting. Didn't have a good statistical season, but he was on a not great team where he had a bigger role than he should've. Very creative scorer but because of his age and inexperience he does struggle with consistency and shot selection. He can get tunnel vision a bit too often, but I wouldn't call him a selfish player as he still did a good job playmaking for his team while still being a bit more of a combo than a natural point guard. Has 3 level scoring potential, shot isn't quite there yet but he does have very good looking shooting mechanics. Would probably call him a slightly above average athlete, also needs to add strength and weight. Struggles with physicality on both ends because of it. At the moment not a good defender but has good size and length (6'8 wingspan) so he could improve.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** He's a bit of a longer term play and more of a combo guard than a true point guard like I mentioned earlier. He does have some stuff like his on ball creation that the Nuggets would appreciate and I think Malone would work wonders with him, but needs a bit of cooking and I don't think he's ready to contribute for a contending team as of now. Malone's leash would probably be a bit too tight for what he needs to develop.


**Availability Rating:** Also low. I think he's probably too talented to make it to the end of the 1st. That being said I could see a world where guards who aren't ready to play minutes this season aren't in big demand and he ends up slipping a bit. But I would say it's less likely for him to make it to our spot compared to Kolek.

#Isaiah Collier, USC, 6'3, 205 lbs, 19 years old, 15th on Tankathon, 22nd on ESPN

Bowling ball style point guard who relies on getting downhill. Was billed as one of the top talents coming into the season, but struggled a lot at the college level. Most of his game relies on him getting into the paint and either finishing through contact or dishing it to the open big man or outside to the open shooters. Has good, but not great speed. Relies more on strength than athleticism to finish in the paint, but is quite decent at it. Below average shooter who struggled mightily from the 3 point line early during the season, but bounced back to a somewhat acceptable 34% on 3 attempts per game. Doesn't have an in between scoring game. Struggled at playmaking out of half court sets, can be very careless with the ball at 3.3 turnovers per game on 30 mpg and overdribbled the ball very often. Great at reading the floor and finding the open man when he does get downhill though. Was billed as a great athlete but looked closer to average during the season, though he did struggle with lower leg nagging injuries. Bad defender and rebounder at the moment but has a good frame/strength combo. Struggled with screen navigation especially.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** Not good in my opinion. He isn't ready to contribute and needs plenty of time in the G League probably. Also has a very different skillset to what we're looking for. Personally I am also not big on these bowling ball style guards who can't shoot the 3. Fits much better on a fast pace transition based team which we are not. Good upside play though, but not really the direction we're likely to go.

**Availability Rating:** It's hard to say. I haven't heard much buzz about him and he was a consistent faller as the season went on. He is still one of these blue chip high school talents who NBA teams can value regardless of performance, but guards like him have fallen pretty far in recent years (Nick Smith, Jaden Hardy, Tyty Washington, Brandon Boston) so I think there's a decent chance he falls to the end of the 1st. Could see him go anywhere in the 15-30 range tbh.

#Baylor Scheierman, Creighton, 6'7, 202 lbs, 23 years old, 33rd on Tankathon, 25th on ESPN

Modern dribble/pass/shoot combo guard. A 5 year college player (3 for South Dakota State, 2 for Creighton) he is as experienced and NBA ready as you're gonna see on this least. Great 3 point shooter with with picture perfect mechanics who is able to shoot off movement, off the dribble and off the catch (career 39% on 5.6 3pa per game) but is more than just a shooter. Has great size for someone who will probably play the 2 on offense, good feel for the game and connective passing ability and good handles. Is able to initiate half court sets. Some people view him more as an off ball player but I think in a motion based offense he can definitely perform some secondary ball handling and playmaking. Probably a below average athlete but not bad. He was good at finishing at the rim at the college level but will struggle a bit against NBA size/athleticism. Not gonna blow by people so will definitely need help coming off screens to set him up. Should be good to attack closeouts. On ball defense is okay as long as he is able to stay in front of his man. Someone you probably need to hide a bit though, and his help defense is quite below average. Great defensive rebounder for his position.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** Offensively he's a great fit, most dribble/pass/shoot combo guards with connective passing skills are gonna be a great fit with the Nuggets. Wouldn't expect him to be a great self creator off the dribble, but as long as he's playing off screens he should be able to provide secondary ball handling and playmaking, in addition to being a great spacer. Defensively he's not good but with two great perimeter defenders in Braun and Watson you should be able to hide him decent enough to the point he's not an issue. He's not a point guard so you'd need someone who is able to perform primary ball handling duties in order to get the best from him though. But overall one of my favorite stylistic fits.

**Availability Rating:** For most of the season he was seen as a fringe second round prospect but since the season ended he's risen up towards the early-mid second round range. As the draft order currently stands up I would say it's very likely he's available at 28. However I do think he could be a target for contending teams trying to move up into the 20s looking for an NBA ready rotation player.

#Jaylon Tyson, California, 6'7, 218 lbs, 21 years old, 28th on Tankathon, 30th on ESPN

Similar dribble/pass/shoot wing style player like Scheierman. I do think he is more of a wing than a combo guard but for all intent purposes of this guide he will be considered a guard just because I'm not talking wings and I think he does deserve a mention here.  Well rounded perimeter player who is able to handle the ball and score, create for himself and shoot at a high level. Good driver and finisher, but more of a crafty one than an athleticism based one. Still an above average athlete though. Very good footwork. Great at creating space off the dribble. Good midrange/in between game. Good 3 point shooter, projects more as an off the catch guy but shows significant off the dribble and off movement promise. Good feel for the game and a willing passer, but hasn't shown he can make advanced reads yet, at least at a consistent level. Needs to improve as a technical passer too. Does turn the ball over more than you'd like. Has not been a good defender so far but should improve as time goes with a reduced offensive role and he does have good size/length/athleticism to become a passable defender. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** He's a pretty good scorer who can create for himself and could be that offensive spark coming off the bench. Like I said, I think he's more of a wing than a combo guard so I think it's a bit harder to fit him into the rotation as the roster is currently constructed. So not a high priority option for me but for sure a guy I would be happy having on the roster nonetheless.

**Availability Rating:** I expect him to go in the 20-30 range. I think there's an okay chance he's there at 28 but teams do like this style of wing players so I think he could be a target for a lot of teams and I wouldn't be surprised to see him go in the early 20s.

#Ajay Mitchell, UC Santa Barbara, 6'4, 197 lbs, 21 years old, 37th on Tankathon, 44th on ESPN

Great combo of skill, size and feel for the game. One of the best passers/playmakers in the class, with amazing feel for the game and processing speed. Has a great patience/skill based inside the arc scoring game, his mid range/floater game is the highlight of it.  Can finish at the rim very well but mostly using body control and angles/touch more than athleticism or speed. Was able to draw a high amount of free throws (6.3 FTA per game). The shot is a bit of a question as he doesn't take many of them (2.9 3pa per game) and most of them are catch and shoot. Seems to shoot better off movement than off the dribble or off the catch. Has great touch and his free throw percentage (86% on high volume) is amazing so I'd expect him to be an above average shooter. Played on a bad team at the mid major level so there are questions about level of competition and how much will his game translate to the NBA level. He was however a standout during the combine scrimmages, having his best game while matched up against Jamal Shead (probably the best defensive guard at the college level). His defensive tape looks bad when you consider the competition level, but he also looked much better during the combine. Not a great athlete, but not a bad one either, not much explosiveness but mobile and agile enough to be functional at the NBA level. Has okay lateral quickness but will struggle against bigger, better explosive athletes at the NBA level. Great size for a guard though. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** He is my personal favorite choice for the Nuggets. Smart player who reads the floor very well, is able to create both for himself and for others and has positional size and versatility. I think he would be able to play right away as the backup point guard and provide good offensive value. Defensively not the best option and he'd probably struggle early on as he adapts to NBA speed but he's a big body which makes it easier to hide him. I think he ticks all of the boxes when it comes to what the Nuggets usually value and look out for and I think he'd be a fantastic fit on our motion offense. Has also worked out for the Nuggets according to HoopsHype.

**Availability Rating:** He's consistently mocked in the early-mid second round range and there hasn't been any buzz about him being a riser. Some talk about him right after the combine but didn't end up in much. I think he's a very solid bet to be available at 28. Could even end up being a mid 2nd round play but if they like him they should just take him at 28 and not risk it.

#KJ Simpson, Colorado, 6'1, 187 lbs, 21 years old, 45th on Tankathon, 52nd on ESPN

The name everyone was expecting to see in here at some point. Classic undersized scoring college combo guard. Really good shooter who will be able to space the floor at the NBA level, can shoot both off the catch and off the dribble. Crafty inside the arc scorer, good floater and in between game, will probably rely a lot on it at the NBA level. He is able to find the open man off drives pretty well and is a very good technical passer. Struggles with shot selection, will probably be exacerbated at the NBA level where he will struggle against bigger and better athletes. One of the smallest players in the draft, measured as the 2nd shortest player at the combine. Projects as a bad NBA defender, mostly due to size and discipline issues. Does play the passing lanes decently, though he can sometimes gamble too much. Shows consistent effort and energy on both sides of the court.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** Just skillset wise he is a good fit on a vacuum. But taking size into account it's really hard to make an argument for him. Don't think he'll be able to get into the paint consistently at the NBA level so he probably ends up as one of these undersized jump shooting reliant guards who aren't really point guards and have a lot of problems at the defensive end. It's a shame cause I think he has the skill and he'd be a great story, but don't think you can justify taking a player this small right now. 

**Availability Rating:** 100% he will be available at 28. I don't know if he will last into the latter half of the 2nd round, could see a team really like him and taking a gamble on him at the 30-45 range. 28 is too early for him in my opinion, if there's any scenario where the Nuggets really want him I think they should trade down a couple of spots.


#Bigs in the late first round range:

#Daron Holmes II, Dayton, 6'10, 236 lbs, 21 years old, 25th on Tankathon, 39th on ESPN

Every year there's a Nuggets online fanbase favorite and this year is no exception with Daron Holmes. A 4/5 hybrid who was dominant at the mid major college level and shows a bit of everything but doesn't have a signature NBA skill. Good driver for a 6'10 guy, decent post up game, worked best as a mismatch scorer type player. Showed above average playmaking and passing skill, mostly coming off his driving and post up game, think at the NBA level he projects much more as a short roll passer. Good finisher with good touch, doesn't rely on dunks entirely. Added a catch and shoot 3 point shot this season and shot it decent but on low volume. Good but not great athlete. Defensively he is at his best as a weakside shot blocker. Don't think he projects as a true defensive anchor, but should be able to switch decently against perimeter based 3s and 4s. Does struggle in some aspects of help defense and with closeouts. He is a bit small for a pure 5 so he will likely struggle against the bigger and stronger interior players of the NBA. Good motor and energy all around.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** I can understand why Nuggets fans like him so much, but I am quite lower on his fit than most. I see people talk about his passing and playmaking a lot and I agree he shows some good things, but I think it's mostly a result of how much attention he commanded at the college level. He is able to pass and find the open man when he gets doubled in the post and when he draws the help defender when driving. I don't think he will ever command the same attention at the NBA level as I don't think his handle is good enough to be a self creator and I don't think he has the skill or the size to be a post up player. I think he will be good at passing in the short roll where he just has to find the open man when the defense collapses on him, but I don't think he can be a DHO hub style passing big. I don't think he will be a non shooter, but I think he will be limited at wide open catch and shoot attempts and I don't think he will be an above average shooter at them. He's a good athlete and a good finisher, but not as good of an athlete or a finisher as you'd want for a rim running big. His shot blocking is good, but I do think he is a true tweener on defense who teams will struggle to find a role for. In the end I just feel he lacks a signature, bread and butter skill at the NBA level and think there's a decent chance he ends up as one of this effort rebounding bigs that aren't above average at anything else and therefore struggle a lot at impacting the game.

**Availability Rating:** I think it's very unlikely he makes it to 28. I know he's a very popular Nuggets pick on mock drafts, and there's a lot of talk that he has received a promise and that we're the team who promised him, but I just think he has too much buzz to make it all the way to 28. Seen rumors about teams picking quite high like Oklahoma and Sacramento liking him a lot, think a lot of teams in the mid 1st round have the need for a backup big as well. I think it's more likely he ends up going in the lottery than he is to fall down to the end of the first. Sorry Nuggets fans. 

#Kyle Filipowski, Duke, 7'0, 230 lbs, 20 years old, 19th on Tankathon, 21st on ESPN

Modern, versatile swiss army knife style offensive big man. Excellent handles and playmaking/passing for a big man. Like Holmes he is able to pass out of drives and post ups really well, but can also function as a DHO hub and is able to playmake out of the perimeter very well. Mismatch scorer type player who is able to create shots for himself inside the arc, was at his best when driving to the rim but also shows competence in posting up especially against smaller players. Billed as a ""stretch 5"" or just as a shooting big, but the 3 point shot remains as a bit of a question, as he has been quite inconsistent and streaky. Shot 35% from 3 on 3.1 attempts per game which is encouraging, but also shot just 67% on free throws which is less encouraging. He's not a good defender, but he is not as bad as some people make him out to be. Definitely not  a defensive anchor and probably won't be a good shot blocker (negative wingspan at 6'10 doesn't help) but has decent recognition and awareness. Can stay out on the perimeter much better than you'd expect even though he doesn't have particularly good lateral quickness. Some motor/attitude concerns, seemed to drift out of games more often than what you'd like. Dealt with a hip injury midseason which apparently some people have some concerns about.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** Offensively I think he's as good as you could possibly ask if you're one of those people who have been wanting someone who can run a more Jokic style offense while he sits. I think he can run many of the DHO sets we run from day 1. I wish the shot was a bit more proven, but I believe he can become at least someone who you can run pick and pops for. The shot creation is  something we could really use as well, and I think Malone could get quite creative with some of the offense we could run with him and the bench unit. Defensively he's a tougher sell, don't expect him to be a good defender, but I think he'd do better in our switch and scramble scheme compared to most teams where he'd be expected to perform a more traditional defensive big role. Overall I have to say he is my favorite choice if we want to go big.

**Availability Rating:** It's hard to say. I would say he's been somewhat of a faller past couple of weeks but nothing too extreme and I haven't heard much buzz about it either. I mentioned the hip injury, which as far as I know it's nothing serious or severe, but I have heard some people mention it recently. I have seen him mocked in the end of the first quite often so it's probably not unlikely, but I personally would not expect him to be available at 28.

#Yves Missi, Baylor, 7'0, 229 lbs, 20 years old, 22nd on Tankathon, 23rd on ESPN

Great twitchy and explosive athlete who mostly projects as a rim running center. Vertical threat on both sides of the ball, will work best on a PNR heavy team where his finishing and his athleticism can be utilized the best. Very simple offensive game, gets 99% of his shots inside the paint. Poor, but not awful free throw shooter at 62% on 4.1 attempts per game. Doesn't show potential as a post up player or really as an outside the paint player in general. Almost non existent passing ability or feel for the game. Will probably struggle passing the ball even in simpler short roll schemes. Good offensive rebounder. Good shot blocker, but his blocking metrics are not as good as most great defensive center prospects. Defensive rebounding has been below average compared to what you'd expect from a rim running big with such athletic tools so far. His best tool on defense is definitely his lateral quickness and agility, shows great promise as a switching big. Needs a lot of development in general, has only been playing basketball for a few years. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** I guess you could make the argument that a player of his style could be a nice change of pace compared to Nikola Jokic. But he's gonna be a PNR big entirely and like I've mentioned earlier, the Nuggets run some of the fewest PNR possessions per game in the entire league. I think it would be extremely unlikely for him to be able to play from day 1 or just to get any minutes in his first year. He is definitely a longer term play, but even in the long term I don't think a rim running big would ever be particularly useful on this team.

**Availability Rating:** I think he will probably be picked in the 20s. There's some center needy teams in that range (Toronto at 19, New Orleans at 21, Milwaukee at 23, New York at 24/25) but most of them need more NBA ready guys so I could totally see them passing up on such a raw prospect. I would say there's a decent chance he's there at 28.

#Kel'el Ware, Indiana, 7'1, 230 lbs, 20 years old, 20th on Tankathon, 24th on ESPN

Another rim running style center, but unlike Missi he shows slight promise as a shooter. Excellent size and length (7'4.5 wingspan) and very good vertical athlete. Great rim finisher, both off the roll and on putback attempts, though mostly on dunks. Shot 43% from the 3 point line this season, but on very low volume at 1.3 attempts per game. Shot 63% from the free throw line (4.5 attempts per game) which of course puts a big question on his shooting numbers. Very inconsistent shooting mechanics. Not someone I would expect to ever become an NBA shooter, but not something you can discard entirely. Below average passer and playmaker, struggles with decision making and reading the floor in general. Decent shot blocker, but despite that he does have some pretty poor defensive metrics. Like in the other side of the ball, he struggles with decision making and reading the floor on the defensive side as well. Quite stiff lateral movement, I'd expect him to struggle at making rotations/recovering in general and more so at switching on the perimeter. Good defensive rebounder. Big motor/effort concerns dating back to his high school years. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** A lot of what I wrote about Missi applies here as well. I think he's more ready to play NBA minutes, but I don't think those minutes are gonna be positive. Personally speaking, he reminds me a lot of the Hasan Whiteside/Christian Wood type players, where yeah they can get stats and highlight plays, but they don't really contribute to winning basketball. Again, PNR big, we don't really play PNR. The defense is also not good, so it's a hard pass for me.

**Availability Rating:** A bit of a similar range to Missi, but expected to go a bit earlier. Usually teams don't pass for very long on this type of size/length/athleticism combo, and you add in the slight jump shooting potential, I think it's quite likely someone will take a shot on him in the 15-25 range. I would not expect him to be available at 28, but it wouldn't be the craziest thing either. 

#Jonathan Mogbo, San Francisco, 6'8, 217 lbs, 22 years old, 39th on Tankathon, 40th on ESPN

Unorthodox big who does most of his work as a ball handler and distributor. Probably the best ball handling big in the draft this year, can handle from the perimeter without set up and without any issues at all. Excellent at playing at a high pace and at pushing the pace, especially in transition and as a grab and go player when he gets defensive rebounds. Grew up playing as a guard until a late grow spurt when he started to play as a big. Because of this he is also an excellent passer and playmaker for the position who displays great feel for the game on the offensive side. 3.6 to 1.8 turnover ratio this season which is elite for a big prospect. Excellent driver and finisher as well, very good explosive athlete, passes very well mostly out of drives but displays great connective passing and can initiate offense in the perimeter as well. Complete non shooter, took a total of 2 3 point attempts in 2 years at San Francisco, not a good free throw shooter at 58%  (2.9 attempts per game) in those two years too. Doesn't have a mid range game either. Projects mostly as a small ball center, he's not a good rim protector or defensive anchor and will struggle inside against the bigger and stronger NBA centers. His role will be more as a switching big, he is decent at defending on the perimeter, but not as proven or as consistent as you'd want him to be. Good lateral quickness and can read the floor well so something he could improve a lot in the future. Great rebounder on both sides of the court. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** He is a very unorthodox player who I have a bit of a hard time seeing what his role on an NBA court is. The fact that he is a complete non spacer makes it hard for me to envision him having a role on a team that is likely to play Christian Braun and Peyton Watson heavy minutes, and I think there's a good chance his driving/playmaking ability gets impacted by not being able to shoot. However there are definitely a lot of things to like about him, and things that the Nuggets value quite high. I'd say he's a fit further down the totem pole for me, but definitely someone I would not be mad about getting.

 **Availability Rating:** He's more of a late riser, wasn't really in draft conversation for most of the season, but don't think he's risen enough to be picked in the first round, I think he's far more of an early 2nd round guy. I would say there's a high chance he's available at 28, but at the same time it wouldn't surprise me if someone was to move up into the 25-30 range to take him. 

#Osasere ""Oso"" Ighodaro, Marquette, 6'11, 235 lbs, 21 years old, 40th on Tankathon, 55th on ESPN

Small ball center with great playmaking abilities. Averaged 3.1 assists per game over the last two seasons with Marquette who play a motion based offense with a lot of DHO actions. Reads the floor on the half court extremely well, is able to pass people open very comfortably, excellent decision maker who will take what the defense gives him, does not turn the ball over often. Has a pretty good and functional handle, was able to create shots for himself a bit mostly as a driver. Good athlete, but much not an above the rim player, relied more on his unorthodox, but effective push shot and has a bit of a floater game. Don't expect him to be a big lob threat and doesn't have the size/strength to be a very efficient inside player. Not an outside shooter, only took 2 total 3 point attempts in 4 years in college. Career 61% (on 3.6 attempts per game) free throw shooter so nothing to project there either. Doesn't project to be a good interior defender or shot blocker, again not very good size, strength or length (only a 6'11 wingspan) for the position. However he is very good at guarding down and switching onto the perimeter, probably one of the best switch bigs in this draft and that should be his calling card at the NBA level defensively. Below average rebounder on both sides of the court.

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** In my opinion he is a fantastic fit with the Denver Nuggets. Just because of how well he passes the ball and how smart of a player he is. I think he can come in and play 15 minutes per game right off the bat without any issue and be that bench DHO hub that the Nuggets have desperately needed for years. Defensively there are some concerns for sure, but I think he is also a really good fit on the Nuggets' switch and recover scheme. One of my personal favorite options for this draft.

 **Availability Rating:** Generally seen as a mid 2nd round, sometimes even as a late 2nd round guy, but don't let that fool you, he will be higher on the board for teams who play with playmaking centers. I do think it's very likely he will be there at 28 and you could even gamble and try getting him in the mid 2nd round, but I would be perfectly happy taking him at 28 and I would not want to risk it. 

#Ulrich Chomche, NBA Academy Africa, 6'11, 232 lbs, 18 years old, 55th on Tankathon, 41st on ESPN

The youngest player eligible for this draft, will only turn 19 midway through the season on December 30th. Not a player I've personally scouted, at least in a real sense, since I don't have access to NBA Academy tape and only played very few minutes at the Basketball Africa League. Really the big wildcard of the draft, seen as one of the best upside plays this year. Highly athletic center who shows flashes on many skills, like 3 point shooting, ball handling and playmaking. Had interest from some big name colleges like Arizona, USC, Texas, among others for the upcoming season, as well as from the G League Ignite before it was disbanded, but decided to enter the draft.  He did play in the combine scrimmages, and the one thing that I can say is that I was impressed by his body, I wasn't expecting him to look as developed as he did. Don't think his body is quite NBA ready yet but does seem far better than many people expected. Basketball wise though, he will definitely need a lot of development before he can play at the NBA level. Like, A LOT of development. 

**How does he fit with the Nuggets?:** ""Two years away from being two years away"" type of guy, so a hard pass from me. Look I wouldn't hate him as an upside play if we had a more finished roster without big needs, but that is just not the case for this year. 

**Availability Rating:** Who knows honestly. He doesn't really have any buzz, but that's just cause there's really nothing to go off. Don't really see any talk of him going in the 1st, but all it takes is one good workout/scrimmage for some team to take a gamble on him earlier than expected. Could see someone like Toronto or Washington just saying ""fuck it let's just take him we got nothing to play for this year"" or something like that. Highly likely he makes it to 28, but probably not far into the 2nd round, as NBA teams tend to love these sort of stash upside players who you can just put in your G League team for a year and not think much about it. 

Continuing with the second round prospects and targets in the comments, as reddit is a really stupid website with a really stupid character limit which I am very close to reaching."
46,Nuggets received a 2025 2nd rounder (from PHI) as part of the Reggie Jackson trade - does this change anyone’s mind about this trade or the off-season in general?,"This combined with the Saric move, and obviously at least two more signings (one of which will most likely be Vlatko), what do we think about the off-season now? I’d say a B all things considered. Would’ve loved for them to spend big money and make a splash move, but this makes me hopeful the front office knows Jokic will be around for at least one more contract, 5-8 years. "
47,Is it worth bringing Justin Holiday back?,"He seemed to figure out how the team worked by the end of season, and was a big reason way the Minnesota series went 7 (granted his shooting disappeared at the end). The team needs shooting, and while he isn’t elite, he is better than what is on the team at the moment. Also, being on the team for a second hear has to mean it’s easier for him.

Their rosters have changed a lot since that matchup, and losing that game actually put us in a position to draft MPJ. Tim Connelly moved from Denver to Minny after setting up the Nuggets *pretty well* and Calvin Booth has been cooking since taking over for Tim here.

52,Saving the season,"If I was Calvin Booth I would make some major changes when free agency rolls around. 

Step 1: trade Zeke Nnaji for Luka. This lets Murray play full time as starting PG for the bench unit and gives us some much needed depth.

Step 2: trade Dallas some cash to bring Zeke Nnaji back. 

Step 3: trade Zeke Nnaji for Devin Booker. This should help if KCP leaves. 

Step 4: we have limited trade assets so I suggest that we kidnap Zeke Nnaji from pheonix (this is allowed because of bird rights) and sign him to the super max.

Step 5: cut jokic/gordon to clear cap space and have them both sign at vet minimum. It’s cool though because under the new CBA we can ask Zeke to share his new Supermax with up to two additional players.

Now that we lost we know where we need to improve the roster, I have no doubt in my mind we will make necessary trades and bounce back next year. Calvin Booth said it best: The goal is to win multiple chips, but we are not going to win a championship every year. Even the Spurs dynasty never went back to back.

66,This team needs to decide ASAP what it wants to be ,"One of my biggest concerns heading into this offseason is that fundamentally, there’s a disconnect and lack of alignment between Booth/the front office and Malone/the coaching staff

We all know what Malone’s inclinations are as coach at this point - winning is the most important outcome (no argument from me) - young players need to earn their role and minutes on the floor and when push comes to shove, if a young player isn’t considered ready he won’t be seeing the floor much, if at all (see: Peyton Watson vs the wolves)

On its face, that doesn’t seem to align much with the most significant moves that Booth made last offseason with their only two veteran “additions” being bringing back Reggie Jackson and DAJ and signing Justin Holiday (while Bruce Brown Ish Smith and Jeff Green all signed elsewhere) - meanwhile, Booth prioritized drafting and development by taking Strawther Pickett and Tyson in the most recent draft

On the one hand, I get why Booth is pivoting towards youth and development on the bench given the new CBA + how much the starting 5 costs + the nuggets luxury tax situation (as of the start of this offseason they’re a second apron team) and that signing more proven vet players to 1 year deals every offseason isn’t sustainable for a team like the nuggets (a team that isn’t necessarily a preferred team for free agents) - at the same time, I’m sure Malone and the coaching staff understandably consider the team to firmly be a win-now team that’s right in their championship window *now*, with Jokic Murray and AG all in the middle of their prime and not getting any younger, combined with the relative absence of a clear favorite in the western conference at the moment   

Regardless of how understandable each position/philosophy is, potential disconnect between the front office and the coaches with how they want the team to look and the trajectory of the team from a team-building perspective going forward is essentially what we saw play out this year - I wasn’t exactly expecting Strawther Pickett and Tyson to all get rotation minutes right away, but not one of Booth’s draft picks played any significant minutes after January this year, while Watson’s role and minutes started to diminish towards the end of the regular season and he ended up being a complete non factor in the second round

Clearly, the nuggets depth needs to be much stronger and more reliable next year, and whether that depth results from less patience with all the younger players next year and having the 6th-8th best players on the team be more proven veteran players, or through the young players particularly Strawther Pickett and Watson developing next year into legit rotation players who can at least be trusted for at least 8-10 minutes per game in a playoff series, the coaches and front office need to actually be in full alignment about picking a path and committing to it starting this offseason "
