0,[Law Murray] Lawrence Frank says Kawhi Leonard is questionable for Sunday.,
1,[Clint Parks Kawhi’s Trainer] Thank you Lawrence Frank for calling out Grant Hill and @usabasketball disrespect of Kawhi Leonard. Too much politics and personal agendas.,
2,(Adrian Wojnarowski) ESPN Sources: Paul George’s agent — Aaron Mintz of CAA — and Clippers president Lawrence Frank had a conversation a short time ago that resulted in no new movement on a deal and an acknowledgment by both that George is unlikely to return to the Clippers.,
3,"[Linn] Lawrence Frank confirmed Paul George was initially offered two years / $60M, but that was in addition to his $50M player option.

Frank said the Clippers then upped their offer to PG without asking once they added James Harden.",
4,"[Law Murray] Lawrence Frank acknowledges Clippers were a wing short, says team needs to get younger",
5,"[Russo] Lawrence Frank said the team is not ""naive enough"" to think they can just run it back and things will be ""all good."" They understand there's steps they need to take.",
6,[Ohm] Lawrence Frank also says Clippers are in contact with the agents for PJ Tucker and Bones Hyland. Frank says both want to play. He also says he has talked extensions for Ivica Zubac and Terance Mann.,
7,"Lawrence Frank on Harden “James was everything we hoped he would be when we acquired him. a proven scorer, gifted passer. “James cares about his craft and works tirelessly at it. We were better for his presence last year and we will be again.”","

"
8,"[Russo] The players for the San Diego Clippers, the Clippers' G League affiliate in Oceanside, will live ""about 100 yards"" from the arena and training center in a brand-new condo complex. Lawrence Frank said he's excited about what that could mean for them.",Poverty franchises hate us 
9,Lawrence Frank and Steve Ballmer congratulating Jordan Miller on his performance tonight ,
10,"[Russo] Lawrence Frank: ""I understand the skepticism, but I would guard against the cynicism. Just because it's happened doesn't mean it's always going to happen next year. We're optimistic we can put together a team that's gonna be a lot better than the group that we finished with.""",
11,"[Law Murray] Lawrence Frank in May: ""We have to take some swings on young players. Maybe right, maybe wrong, but we developed that kind of third line of players... some fallen angels, guys that may have been lottery picks that showed in the NBA minutes that they can do it.""",
12,"Terance Mann, Kevin Porter Jr., Max Christie, Lawrence Frank, Steve Ballmer among those in attendance for Clippers-Nuggets.",
13,"[Law Murray] Lawrence Frank on 46 pick: ""I think this draft has a healthy middle class... I think there's a lot of good players... we got to find the right player.""",
14,[Tomer]Lawrence Frank says he was disappointed Team USA’s decision to remove Kawhi Leonard from the Olympic team. Frank said Kawhi looked great the first two days and wishes USA basketball gave Kawhi more time. ,
15,"[Law Murray] Lawrence Frank says that Clippers love Paul, want to retain Paul, have had ongoing conversations with him and his representation  “We hope Paul’s decision is to be here.”",
16,"Kendrick Perkins ""Clippers Should Consider Trading Kawhi"" Questions Lawrence Frank's Mind",
17,"Interesting free agent targets to consider getting with the MLE (if we aren’t capped by the second apron) or vet minimum contracts to fill the hole of defensive rebounding, athleticism, and a wing player that Lawrence Frank mentioned. Low risk high reward players.",
18,The Real Issue With Lawrence Frank & The Clippers FO,"Lawrence Frank & Clippers FO has gotten a lot of criticism as of late deservingly so over some of his decisions he has made over the past several years, however the biggest problem with him and the rest of the FO is their inability to DRAFT and DEVELOP during the 213 era. 

2023: Kobe Brown - Barely played/TBD

2023: Jordan Miller - Barely played/TBD

2022: Moussa Diabate - Barely played/Questionable NBA future

2021: Brandon Boston Jr - Unsuccessful ""pick"" (we technically didn't draft him)

2021: Keon Johnson - Out the league

2021: Jason Preston - Released (Now w/ Utah Jazz on two-way contract)

2020:  Daniel Oturu - Out the league

2020: Jay Scrubb -  Out the league

2019: Mfiondu Kabengele - Out the league

2019: Terance Mann - Great pick

2019: Amir Coffey - Good undrafted signing 

Now sure, most 2nd round picks are not going to work out, but to be THIS bad in both the 1st AND 2nd round of drafts is a fireable offense. Our competitors have had much better success at drafting & developing while obtaining talent through FA & timely trades in recent years.

"
19,The First Change We Need is to Fire Lawrence Frank,"No, not because of the PG trade--hindsight is 20/20 and any GM makes that trade.  I'm talking about the way the roster has been poorly constructed since then.

To get it out of the way, obviously he has made some good moves, so credit where it is due but almost all of them happened during the first two years of 213.

Good moves in my book:

-Signing Batum

-Signing Reggie

-The Marcus Morris trade (yeah, he ended up declining precipitously later, but he was key for a long time).

-The Norm Powell trade (though this one is marred by what happened with RoCo--see below).

Bad moves:

- **Failure to communicate with the coaching staff**.  This arguably happened during the Doc era and Ty Lue.  Most obvious example was RoCo--if we aren't going to use him, we should have flipped him for other assets while he still had value.  Instead he ended up being salary filler because he sat on the bench for 2+ years.

- **Signing Russell Westbrook**.  If his name was Ross Eastbrook, he wouldn't make any NBA roster, let alone one competing for a championship.  And it's no excuse that the players wanted him--the front office's job is to make decisions with the long term future of the franchise in mind, not the players' whims.

- **Trading Pat Bev**.  He was a critical piece of our defensive identity and was traded for Eric Bledsoe who was clearly washed and ruined our spacing to a degree we never really recovered from.

- **Trading Reggie for Plumlee**.  Not so much about trading Reggie itself as he had arguably run his course here but as we just saw, Plumlee is not playable in a playoff series and Reggie (at that time) was a valuable asset that could have gotten us something more useful.

- **Signing John Wall + Letting Hartenstein go**.  This is arguably the worst move of Frank's tenure.  Hartenstein was SO valuable to this team and as we are seeing with the Knicks he hadn't even hit his ceiling yet.  He was willing to re-sign with us for very little (mid-level exception) but we let him go because he inexplicably wanted to sign John Wall, a player the entire rest of the league realized was washed, but we wanted for some reason.

- **Trading Luke Kennard for Eric Gordon**.  Like the Reggie trade, this isn't so much about the decision to move on from Luke as it is about what we got in return--Gordon was garbage in the one playoff series he played in for us and then we didn't pick up his option so he just walked for nothing.

- **Keeping Russ on the team after we traded for Harden**.  Any justification for having him on the team went away when they got Harden.  Since it was clear him and Harden couldn't play together, he should have been bought out or moved at the deadline.

- **Signing Kawhi Leonard to an extension.**  Kawhi has a degenerative knee condition that is well known.  In addition, we just got a major new piece in Harden.  Wouldn't it make sense to wait and see if they can succeed in even a single post-season before deciding to commit to Kawhi long term?  Instead, we are now in a borderline Ben Simmons-type situation.

- **Zero good draft picks in the 213 era.**  I get that it's hard to hit on second rounders/late firsts but he hasn't drafted anyone who remotely resembles an NBA player (the jury is still out on Kobe Brown maybe but I'm not optimistic).

------

Look, every GM makes mistakes and Frank is not the worst in the league but a fresh perspective would be a good place to start whether we want to retool or completely rebuild."

Then they build the oldest team in the league. Then they neglect trading for the size we need to compete. Lawrence Frank makes braindead move after braindead move. This Front office needs to be fired immediately and replaced if we want a chance at ever competing. I also suspect one of the only good moves they've made (getting Norman Powell) was because the trailblazers did Balmer a favor because of the Microsoft connection.

48,The Los Angeles Clippers will be the 2024-2025 NBA Champions. Kawhi Leonard will win MVP and FMVP. The first season in the new arena will be a massive success. Let's go!,"We don't just have what it takes to win, we have what it takes to have one of the best seasons of all time and win the chip in overwhelming fashion. The 26-5 run shows we have something great, this offseason will be big since now harden will have a full offseason to gel with the team which is important because he is the main ball handler and runs our offence. Once our team is clicking on all fronts then 26-5 will seem mediocre, I think we could go on a way better run then that and blow people away. We still have some big needs to fill though, so don't think I'm dismissive of that. If we don't figure out our power forward situation we won't win, we need to get a better front office and the PF situation needs to be solved. Not just that though, we need to get younger and bigger. To many old players that are also kind of slow and get bodied by bigger players and more athletic players. We can not win the chip as the oldest team, so getting younger, more athletic and bigger as well across the roster is very very important. Honestly our front office is bad and Lawrence Frank needs to go, I really hope we can get things sorted on that front. But like I said the 26-5 run showed some of our potential and we can grow on that. Also having our own arena will allow us to have a much better schedule with less back to backs, 5 in 7s, early sunday games etc. Our schedule this season will be the best we've ever seen and that could help keep our players in good shape. Kawhi Leonard is still the best player in the world, people doubt him but he has still shown he has one of the most lethal offences and can still shut down opposing stars. Kawhi will decimate everyone this season, I think he will win MVP and FMVP. We have a good supporting cast which will get better when we fill all the holes and we will go on to win it all."
49,I’m done,"Lawrence Frank, Steve Balmer & Trent Redden: Respectfully, ya’ll are terrible. We already had the foundation for a deep playoff team and now it’s ruined since you traded all of the team’s assets and versatility for James Harden. I’ve said this once and I’ll say it again, this was basketball suicide. You have two superstar level players and a ball dominant point guard surrounded by 3&D wings and good shooters along with starting the season hot, and then you proceed to trade those 3&D wings for another ball dominant point guard and the only defensive compensation we get back is a 38 year old PJ Tucker… absolutely wonderful. It’s physically painful watching these games man, I came into the year optimistic but this was the final nail in the coffin. Sapped every ounce of life outta me. 0-6 after the Harden trade, yay! Great job guys. It’s not an overreaction anymore, this team is shit. 👍🏾

Ty Lue: You and your small ball lineups, horrible late game rotations and decisions, and the lack of understanding on how to properly utilize the players you have on your roster gotta GO along with that dumbfounded confused look you have every time we take an L. I understand that you were dealt a bad hand with how the roster is currently constructed, but if anything this highlights just how bad these tendencies of going small are, problems you’ve had for a while. I just watched us fumble this game at Denver because our genius head coach decided to sub PJ Tucker out of the game what, 2 minutes left in the 4th? Jokic just got down in the paint, put his head down and mismatch hunted every single possession, and if he wasn’t the one to score or missed the shot guess who got the second lick? Aaron Gordon, easy rim run. Every damn time. Zubac is just sitting on the bench looking stupid, what the hell is this team anymore? There’s spurts where this team looks promising or looks like they’re clicking and then they go and revert back to bad habits and lose. It’s unbearable. I want this season to end already and we’re 10 games in. Ty Lue count your fucking days.

James Harden: You wanted to be here, you pushed for this trade to happen and made it clear this was the only team you’d go to so you get a piece of the blame pie too. What did you think was gonna happen, Mr. “I’m the system”? That everyone else would change their games to fit around YOU and everything would be kumbaya? There was an adjustment period with Russ last year and that’s when we had a solid team all around, and the only reason he became very effective for us is because he was the primary ball handler. Now that’s changed and this Denver game was probably the worst game I’ve seen Russ play since Game 5 of the Suns series last year. The fit has been awkward and Harden hasn’t looked like the Harden we know and that makes sense because the fit doesn’t make sense. (FYI for anyone who might think I’m pinning everything on Harden, I’m not. I realize he’s not the SOLE reason the Clippers have been losing these games but the trade overall really hurt this team’s defense and trying to fit Harden into offensive schemes and get him comfortable has messed up the rhythm of everyone excluding PG who’s started to adjust. Kawhi looks absolutely horrible however, and I think this has something to do with it. So I say Harden has a pretty big portion of the blame.) 

For anyone continuing to watch this team after this shitshow, ya’ll are soliders. I hope you guys have a good night, these are rough times. I’m actually sitting here reminiscing over the times we had RoCo, Batum, and Mook. Fuckin Mook bro. This team frustrates me, I want this to work and I’m trying to have faith but it’s really difficult not calling out the issues. 😭"
50,"Forget PG walking, signing KPJ is disgusting","The front office needs to go man. Done with their BS. Bad decisions are forgivable, this is just disgusting and vile from the Front Office. It's a slap in the face for all women supporting the team. Hope the clippers reporters don't let them get away with this. Shame on Lawrence Frank and whoever else (even if that includes balmer) for signing up on this"

Do you remember the Marcus Morris fiasco?

Robert Covington fiasco? 

Zubac and Mann fiasco (not playing them enough minutes)? 

3-4 guard line-ups fiasco? 

Westbrick/Coffey/Plumlee/PJ fiasco? 

Pelicans fiasco? (24-7 run to lose Play-in game) 

Suns game 2 fiasco where he didn't put a man to box out Ayton? 

16 out of 24 periods of scoring below 25 fiasco? 

30 point blowout (largest blowout in team's history in our last game in the arena) fiasco?

Tanking the RS games to dodge the fucking Lakers and losing 2 Play-in games in a row to not even make the play-offs fiasco? 

Embarrassingly losing first 2 home games to Dallas fiasco? 

2 5-6 losing streak (that costed us the 1 seed) fiasco? 

Consistently league bottom in pace and offensive/defensive efficiency fiasco? 

Terrible record against top 6 year after year fiasco?

**And countless more that I can't even remember. **

Year after year after year this dude produces nothing fiasco after fiasco. 

Before y'all say that Kawhi injured or if I know any better than an NBA coach. 

Knicks won the series against Embiid/Sixers without Randle. 

Nuggets won the series against Dame/Portland without Murray. 

Miami went onto a fairytale Final run TWICE (underdog at every series). 

So it is doable, there is precedent. Good coaches are able to clutch it out or make it insanely competitive. Ty Lie's teams show 0 heart. 

You don't need to be a president to observe Donald Trump is full of shit. 

There are more problems than Ty Lue like medical staff (y'all remember how many times PG, Powell, Morris etc. were cleared to play yet immediately re-injured?, roster construction (remember iHart-Wall trade and many more stupid shit?), Lawrence Frank (y'all remember the pre-school level text messages?). Clean the house all together. 

These are all documented problems that needs to be solved. We have been fucking telling this for years. 

Ty Lue, Medical staff, Lawrence Frank, the players... We need a complete rebuild. As of now I am sorry but Clippers are not a serious organization.

61,Rebuild at this point ,Honestly at this point there’s no point in keeping most of the team. The stars are getting older and it seems like they ain’t winning anything in the future. In my opinion I think they need to build around the younger guys maybe Kai and or Hyland. Trade for picks and bigger cap space. I’m just disappointed with how it went towards the end. What do yall think tho.
62,Clippers MUST Make These Adjustments ASAP To Succeed,"Terance Mann starts, Westbrook comes off the bench.

NO MORE PJ TUCKER MINUTES. He must accept an end-of-the-bench role from here on out.

NO MORE 3-GUARD, 4-GUARD, or 5-GUARD LINEUPS. Those lineups are a scam and they are getting destroyed in those lineups.

Lawrence Frank cannot wait any longer to sign or trade for a backup center. I don't even care who it is anymore; just sign or trade for a big ASAP.

Kobe Brown and Moussa Diabate must be inserted into the rotation for now. Both can be positive contributors if given a fair opportunity. 

If Ty Lue and Lawrence Frank cannot make the proper adjustments, this year's team will never succeed no matter what. "
63,Sentiments from a Kawhi Leonard Fan ,"Do you guys ever think that the Clippers might actually be a cursed franchise?

 As a fan of Kawhi I’ve semi-rooted for the Clippers for a couple years now, even during Lob City I was kinda a fan and respected CP after he beat us in Game 7 in 2015. But the mixture of monumental collapses and year after year of being plagued by injuries feels unreal. I’m not superstitious at all but I can’t help but wonder perhaps an upset Lakers fan sacrificed the blood of a lamb and cursed the Clippers into perpetual mediocrity. Kawhi was always injury prone even with the Spurs, but he could usually last a season. It just feels absurd that in 5 years he could only stay healthy in the one where there was a 4-month break. And don’t get me wrong the Spurs have obviously had plenty of tough losses over the years. (Our final possession against the Nuggets in 2019 was one of the worst you’ll see in basketball.) Every franchise has moments of failure, but it feels as if whenever the Clippers fail it’s moments of spectacular failure. Like it’s not just a team executed better down the stretch and they lose. It’s the Clippers players completely forgetting how to play basketball and literally coming apart at the seams. It would be funny if it didn’t look so damn miserable. Games 3 and 5 of this series were insanely bad. And even as a fan of Kawhi I’ve grown frustrated with his constant injuries. Every year it’s promises of championships and success only to end with an injury and losing to an inferior team. The same excuse always being “well if Kawhi was healthy”. But he’s not healthy and frankly I don’t think it’s likely he has an entire season left in him. Now Balmer has extended Kawhi for 3 more years after you guys already traded a ton of your picks and SGA for PG. I’m just saying that the Clippers franchise feels cursed and I hope whatever dark magic hangs over this organization can dissipate when you guys move to the Intuit. 

 Since this is likely Kawhi’s last contract (I doubt even Balmer is foolish enough to offer him another one) I just hope he can be healthy at least one more season to do enough so he can get his number retired with you guys, because for a player as talented as him it would be a damn shame to never get his jersey retired and I think with the Clippers is his best shot. He won a chip with the Raptors sure but I don’t think that one year was enough to earn a jersey retirement. And though he did a lot for us most Spurs fans would sooner retire Derrick White’s jersey (we love our bald king) before his, so even though he won a FMVP and 2 DPOYS and 2 All-NBA first teams in SA there’s not a shot in hell for that. Anyways I’m just saying that as fan of Kawhi I understand a little of this fanbases pain. And I hope after moving into the Intuit you guys can see some playoff success and health luck. At least until Wemby starts running the league with an ironfist.

 Good luck in Game 6. 

P.S. I know a lot of you are frustrated with Ty Lue and some of his coaching decisions this series, I’m certainly not saying he’s Spo, but be a bit more cautious about wanting him fired unless you guys are certain Balmer and Lawrence Frank have the insight to be able to pick a better head coach. He might get fired and the next thing you know you’re stuck with a rookie head coach who’s expected to win a championship in the 3 years Kawhi is still there. And obviously I’m speaking from a place of immense bias but I think one of the most overlooked things in the modern NBA is consistency at the head coaching position. Coaches improve, no one thought Spo was a HOF coach with the Heatles, now a decade later and he’s the undisputed best coach in the league. I think if you give Ty Lue a relatively healthy roster from October-June he’s good enough to win a championship. But obviously you all would know better than me, just my opinion watching the team.

68,Clippers are not a championship team,"Based on the talent on this roster, the Clippers should be a championship team but unfortunately their not. Lawrence Frank made a big mistake not making any moves in the trade deadline, he should’ve at least get some pieces in exchange for Tucker & Bones at least. 

The loss to OKC and the 2 loses to the Timberwolves are concerning & may pay dividends in the playoffs. The Clippers need more depth at that wing & 4 position. Amir Coffey, Kobe Brown and Brandon Boston Jr aren’t good enough wings coming off the bench where u can depend on that. 

Too many fans are blaming Russ for some of the bad loses this season but u need another scoring punch off the bench, not just Powell. A good 3 & D player with size is necessary for the Clips to win cause other teams got more size than us. 

Clippers need to get someone in the buyout market desperately cause this roster right now isn’t good enough to go to that next level"
69,The Clear Move to Make this Summer,"Hire Sam Presti + Invest in draft scouting.

It seems clear Lawrence Frank is on the way out. But more importantly we need someone who can utilize draft capital rather than burn it. We need to be able to retool our roster to be younger and have more length. Our scouting has seemed deficient for years given our draft record seemingly always taking guys who aren’t NBA players in the first round other than Shai. While Sam Presti may not want to leave a great situation, he also knows the ownership group didn’t pay for top talent last time they were in this situation when harden had to be traded and thus this window may be smaller than you think. More importantly Presti can be offered likely more money by the clippers than anyone else. Not just due to Ballmer, but also because of what it would mean to the clippers to get Presti and weaken OKC who has swap rights with the clippers for awhile and thus there is a big incentive for the clippers for OKC to get worse. Sam Presti is NOT the president of basketball operations for OKC so the clippers could offer him a title promotion by hiring him so I believe they could interview him as it is not a lateral move. What’s stopping Ballmer from giving Presti a blank check? This is even more imperative with the new CBA."
70,This team needs a complete rebuild.,"And I just don't mean the players. Everything from top to bottom. 

The medical team is a joke (I can't overstate this enough).

Lawrence Frank is a joke.

Remember pre-school level of text messages from last year? 

Can't draft to save his life.

Didn't make a trade at the deadline where there have been glaring weaknesses of 3&D wings. 

Shit ton of quality role players were available during this time and Frank botched. 

iHart- Wall trade was a joke.

Kennard-Gordon trade was a joke (costed Cam Whitmore on top of it). 

Hyland trade was a joke (Denver want absolutely nothing with that guy.) 

Harkless trade was a joke.(Costed Jaime Jacquez Jr.) 

And there is going to be endless discussions about PG and Harden trades but I will not get into that.

PG's self confidence is a joke. It seems like only setting he is able to play reliably is where he is one of primary ball handler and we need to trade Kawhi in that instance. 

Kawhi's knees are a joke (5 straight years he either choked or was injured). I like him but no excuses. He raked up 250 FUCKING MILLION DOLLARS or whatever in this stretch. And the reward was a big fat contract extension. 

Westbrook's shooting is a joke. Yeah yeah he bring energy or what not but what does that gonna do if he is played off the court 2/3 of the time? 

Depth and versatility is a joke. 

Team's future is a joke because they traded away all the picks and SGA. 

Tyliban Loo aka Tylol Cold is a joke. (I don't like Doc at all but he was right about this one right here). Remember 3-4 guard line ups? Remember random ass 5-6 games losing streaks each year? 

Shall I count more? 

And the worst thing is every time we said anything about that it was downplayed as being a doomer. Hell even the fan base is a joke.

I don't even care if the team wins in this round either Denver or OKC will zap this team up in 5.

73,"The most significant problem with this team is simple, and it's not new...","We Clippers fans have spent the last year and a half trying to figure out who to blame for our steady demise. It's Lawrence Frank. It's Marcus Morris. It's Ty Lue. It's PG. It's Zu. It's the lack of a backup center. It's...you get the point. There is no lack of blame being thrown around, and now it is being tossed at the new low hanging fruit: Harden.

Well, it's probably a little bit of all of that; however, I cannot get past one simple issue that has been true no matter who was on the roster or in the starting lineup over the last two years. That is, if a team wants to beat the Clippers, they simply have to agree to play hard for four quarters. That's it. Play hard. I wrote in the game chat at the start of the Nuggets game that ""hungry teams are our kryptonite."" And it is largely true, and definitely not anything new, as we saw this play out over the course of last year.

The Clippers have the second highest paid lineup in the NBA. They also have four guaranteed future HOFers. On paper, you would ask who the Clippers might end up playing in the WCF because that series is inevitable.  However, it's not. In fact, it's borderline laughable to think this team could make it there. But why??? Well, I will tell you...

This team has zero leadership and might be, at this point, full on anti-leadership. When you are an NBA veteran and can no longer figure out how to get up for games, you have no leadership. When you are a young NBA player and cannot figure out how to get up for games, nobody is teaching you. After watching the 213 era for years, I can no longer see any leadership or guess who it might come from. Ty Lue has looked checked out and I think that has to do with his lack of control of the roster. Paul George is admittedly not a strong leader. He is a nice guy and homie to most in the NBA, but he has never been known for leadership. The same is quite apparent with Kawhi. After years and years of watching Kawhi, it's hard for anyone to convince me that Kawhi is a leader on and off the court. Those three people are your top guys on the squad and I don't get ANY leadership vibes from any of them. I think they are all three very talented folks in their own right, but no longer see any leadership.

We have also moved on from guys like PatBev and Batum that, although secondary players, had those leadership type of skills both on and off the court. We have not replaced them with similar guys. As for Russ and James, they are still so new. Russ is the type of leader we need, but he can only do so much as the 3rd or 4th guy playing a clear backup role. James is so new that he doesn't even look like he is comfortable to shoot an open shot. No matter how kind and gentle and sweet he is to his teammates, Harden also gives off vibes of ""I will play when I play on my own terms."" For better or worse, it is what it is.

Bottom Line: This team does not consistently play hard. This team does not respond well to being punched in the face. This team, again, looks absolutely disinterested in the regular season, months after declaring the regular season is important. Teams with 4 future HOFers that are not completely washed should NEVER lose a game like they did to Denver. Never. There is zero excuse. If they play hard, they win going away. It's inexcusable and the only thing I could think is that nobody was stepping up to change the energy. Change the attitude. Change ANYTHING about that putrid performance. I'm not worried about the talent level of the team, how washed certain stars are, or if Zu sucks or not. I'm worried we have a team that is just showing up, collecting checks, and relying on ""talent"" to beat everyone. Well, if that is the formula, we are done. The NBA is way too good to just show up and beat people. I think we learned that two nights ago. The only way this changes is if someone steps up and leads, changes the attitude, and plays like an old school Clipper. You know, those Clippers that felt so disrespected that they were going to go at you, no matter what, every time they walked on the court."
74,Kobe told everybody bu no one listened,It is enough fire Lawrence Frank.
75,33 days till the start of the season!,
76,I’m done,"Lawrence Frank, Steve Balmer & Trent Redden: Respectfully, ya’ll are terrible. We already had the foundation for a deep playoff team and now it’s ruined since you traded all of the team’s assets and versatility for James Harden. I’ve said this once and I’ll say it again, this was basketball suicide. You have two superstar level players and a ball dominant point guard surrounded by 3&D wings and good shooters along with starting the season hot, and then you proceed to trade those 3&D wings for another ball dominant point guard and the only defensive compensation we get back is a 38 year old PJ Tucker… absolutely wonderful. It’s physically painful watching these games man, I came into the year optimistic but this was the final nail in the coffin. Sapped every ounce of life outta me. 0-6 after the Harden trade, yay! Great job guys. It’s not an overreaction anymore, this team is shit. 👍🏾

Ty Lue: You and your small ball lineups, horrible late game rotations and decisions, and the lack of understanding on how to properly utilize the players you have on your roster gotta GO along with that dumbfounded confused look you have every time we take an L. I understand that you were dealt a bad hand with how the roster is currently constructed, but if anything this highlights just how bad these tendencies of going small are, problems you’ve had for a while. I just watched us fumble this game at Denver because our genius head coach decided to sub PJ Tucker out of the game what, 2 minutes left in the 4th? Jokic just got down in the paint, put his head down and mismatch hunted every single possession, and if he wasn’t the one to score or missed the shot guess who got the second lick? Aaron Gordon, easy rim run. Every damn time. Zubac is just sitting on the bench looking stupid, what the hell is this team anymore? There’s spurts where this team looks promising or looks like they’re clicking and then they go and revert back to bad habits and lose. It’s unbearable. I want this season to end already and we’re 10 games in. Ty Lue count your fucking days.

James Harden: You wanted to be here, you pushed for this trade to happen and made it clear this was the only team you’d go to so you get a piece of the blame pie too. What did you think was gonna happen, Mr. “I’m the system”? That everyone else would change their games to fit around YOU and everything would be kumbaya? There was an adjustment period with Russ last year and that’s when we had a solid team all around, and the only reason he became very effective for us is because he was the primary ball handler. Now that’s changed and this Denver game was probably the worst game I’ve seen Russ play since Game 5 of the Suns series last year. The fit has been awkward and Harden hasn’t looked like the Harden we know and that makes sense because the fit doesn’t make sense. (FYI for anyone who might think I’m pinning everything on Harden, I’m not. I realize he’s not the SOLE reason the Clippers have been losing these games but the trade overall really hurt this team’s defense and trying to fit Harden into offensive schemes and get him comfortable has messed up the rhythm of everyone excluding PG who’s started to adjust. Kawhi looks absolutely horrible however, and I think this has something to do with it. So I say Harden has a pretty big portion of the blame.) 

For anyone continuing to watch this team after this shitshow, ya’ll are soliders. I hope you guys have a good night, these are rough times. I’m actually sitting here reminiscing over the times we had RoCo, Batum, and Mook. Fuckin Mook bro. This team frustrates me, I want this to work and I’m trying to have faith but it’s really difficult not calling out the issues. 😭"
