0,[Haynes] Dallas Mavericks have inked general manager Nico Harrison to a multi-year contract extension,
1,[Grant Afseth] Nico Harrison says he anticipates “nothing happening” with the players who ranked in the “top seven or eight” for minutes played.,"For context the top 7 in minutes (per game) are Luka, Kyrie, PJ, Gafford, Lively, DJJ, Green

The 8th would be THJ from the regular season, Maxi from playoffs

He also said “Regarding Derrick Jones Jr., Harrison called him “priority 1A and 1B” and will do whatever required to re-sign him.”
"
2,"[Givony] Rich Paul: ""Nico Harrison is like an uncle to Bronny. If the Lakers don't take him at 55, Dallas would take him at 58 and give him a guaranteed deal.""","""There are other teams that love Bronny. For example, Minnesota Timberwolves, Dallas Mavericks, Toronto Raptors. If it's not the Lakers, it will be someone else. Minnesota would love to get Bronny in, but I don't know who their owner is going to be. \[Mavs GM\] Nico Harrison is like an uncle to Bronny. If the Lakers don't take him at 55, Dallas would take him at 58 and give him a guaranteed deal. Masai \[Ujiri, Raptors president\], loves him. They could take him without even seeing him at 31. Workouts aren't everything for these teams.""

4,"[Townsend] Nico Harrison’s trade-deadline handiwork:  P.J. Washington: 32 points, 5 rebounds, 5 steals, 3 assists, 2 blocks.  Daniel Gafford: 10 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 blocks.",
5,Nico. F*cking. Harrison. ,"I know we give him a lot of love as is in this sub but letting it all sink in with how he’s completely revamped the roster over the course of just 3 years really puts it all into perspective. If you had told me in 2021 that by 2024;


- the Mavs would have a Finals and a WCF appearance

- their lineup would include Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, PJ Washington, and somehow still Dwight Powell

- A player on their roster in 20-21 would be named Head Coach of the Lakers 


I would’ve asked you to put down the pipe, and yet, over the course of 3 years Nico has leveraged a 19 year career at Nike working with players that included calling Steph Curry “Seth” in the pitch meeting that made him change to Under Armor and turned a roster that actually let Nicolò Melli and Boban get playing time into a 2-3 year championship window, solid younger players on Luka’s timeline to continue to contend when the older players don’t fit anymore, and a roster that was only thwarted by a stacked Boston team coached by some unholy combination of Ron Swanson and Rain Man. 


TL;DR: In Nico We Trust, go sign DSJ and let’s get this second banner."
6,Nico Harrison has been borderline one of the best GMs in the league what he has done improving this  ,
7,[Stein] Sources tell @TheSteinLine that Nico Harrison and Michael Finley were scheduled to be in Calif. for Sunday's start of free agency to pitch Klay directly while the Mavs remain engaged with Golden State on sign-and-trade talks should he choose them.,
8,"[@CoachTomlin] Really appreciative to have some special guests/friends at practice today. Thanks to @RealJasonKidd, @NicoHarrisonGM and @LeVelleMoton for being around the last few days, sharing ideas and just talking ball. I love it.",

10,"[Weber] Nico Harrison if Melvin Ajinca will play for the Mavs or continue to play overseas: “The beauty of him being a European player, we have a lot of optionality, and I think both things are on the table. We don’t have a lot of roster spots available…We can kind of figure it out as we go.”",
11,"[Mavs Film Room] “When you’re not playing up the the expectations you had coming into the season, then you have to make those types of changes.” -Nico Harrison with @TheSteinLine on @971TheFreak on the trade deadline",
12,"Nico Harrison 2024 draft press conference, full",
13,Where in the world is Nico Harrison? Watching his boys in Okinawa!,
14,TIL Klay Thompson and Paul George are the same age (long rant in comments),"Both Klay and PG are 34. 

One got a 4 year max $212 million and the other got a 3 year $50 million. 

Those are the facts. 

Stop reading here if you just wanted the TIL but keep reading if you want to hear the ramblings of a 15+ year Mavs fan. 

Now you might say Klay didn’t play for 2 years with the ACL and Achilles injuries so the price has injuries factored in. In the last three seasons after recovering, Klay has averaged about 59 games while PG averaged 53. Many of us forget before the injuries, Klay was seen as one of the NBA best iron mans, consistently playing 70-80 games per regular season. 

To be fair, PG is a better defender and rebounder at this stage in his career than Klay. Is that really worth a $36 million dollar per year difference? Especially when Klay’s shooting efficiency far exceeds PG’s. While the Sixers have turned into a “legitimate big 3,” no one is talking about the Mavs having a real big 3 potentially due to how Klay’s departure went in GS. 

Why is this important?

EVERYONE IS STILL UNDERRATING THE DALLAS MAVERICKS. 

Go look at any next season rankings. Many have the Celtics,Thunder, Wolves, Knicks, possibly Nuggets all ranked higher than the Mavs. 

This is absurd. A team that was JUST in the Finals with their superstar not at 100% and added not only one of the best shooters in the league but one of the best shooters OF ALL TIME to replace a vet min wing who over performed for us (we still love you DJJ,) should EASILY be a title favorite. But according to betting odds, the Mavs title odds didn’t change AT ALL after landing Klay. 

We, as Mavs fans have always known that the franchise has been criminally underrated, keeping us from signing many free agents in the past. Now that Klay has also become underrated as well, there is now a massive discrepancy in how the Mavs are seen as well. 

Critics say the Mavs defense will take a step back this year since we lost DJJ. As much as we all love DJJ, when has losing a vet min player ever been that impactful for a championship caliber team? I, for one, am personally excited to see a non vet min player (Naji Marshall) perform in DJJ’s role and given Kidd and Sweeney’s resume, I think they will be able to get the  most out of this defense. 

Side note: the Mavs usually play their best defense after scoring on a possession so imo adding Klay’s shooting will really help energize Luka on defense. 

After the Celtics won, we have seen the blueprint for modern championship teams: having an extremely deep roster to surround your two stars. This is now what Nico Harrison has built. Kyrie and Luka are now surrounded by Klay, PJ, DLive, Gafford, Grimes, Marshall, Hardy, Maxi, Exum. A roster that is legitimately 10-11 players deep. 

To quote one of my favorite movies Moneyball: “People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws. Age, appearance, personality. Nico Harrison and mathematics cuts straight through all of that.”

All joking aside, Nico has built this roster in a way I didn’t even think possible. The Mavs should be title favorites with the Celtics and have the best big 3 in the league hands down. 

I am so excited for next season and all Mavs fans should be as well. This is the best roster the Mavs have ever had in their entire franchise history and I don’t think it’s particularly close. 

/rant

tl;dr Take all of your money and put it on the Mavs winning the championship this year and Luka winning MVP

15,Rank the Top 8 most important Mavericks as we enter the Finals:,"My personal take:

1) Luka
2) Kyrie
3) D-Live
4) PJ
5) Maxi
6) Gafford

8) Green

Honorable mentions: #9 Hardy #10 Exum but Maxis ability to defend while retaining our size may be a key matchup

As you can see the roster has changed dramatically. McGee was so washed Powell had to start after a few games that season. Nico Harrison has done an amazing job on how he has transformed this roster with limited assets on hand."
17,Congrats to D-Live for making the 2nd all rookie NBA team! (credit to @dallasmavs insta),
18,Time To Give Nico Some Praise?,"I wasn't a fan of Nico Harrison and his initial moves as the Dallas Mavericks GM. But, after watching this team for the last 3 weeks, I think that Nico deserves some praise. He came into a bad situation, with the Mavericks reeling from a nasty divorce from their coach and a bad trade for Kristaps Porzingis. But, after some questionable early decisions, Nico has turned things around...completely. Trading away all of the misfitting parts to wind up with Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington and Dereck Lively was a stroke of genius. This is exactly what Luka needed. They needed another athletic rim runner and protector to go along with an excellent wing defender. When you run out Luka and Kyrie, two of the most dominant offensive forces in the league, you need some dynamic defensive help. Throw in Lively with Gafford and Washington, and you have a pretty good situation, created by Nico."
19,[Mark Followill] Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving have played 60 games (reg season & playoffs) together this season. Saturday's Game 3 win vs OKC was the first time in those 60 games that either Luka or Kai were not the leading scorers for the Mavs in the game. PJ Washington Jr. led Dallas w/ 27 pts.,
20,I'm not concerned at all,"I see people crying about Cuban and all that, but I'm not because I got faith in Nico. He putting this thing together little by little with hardly any assets to work with. I knew when he took the job that this was gonna take 3 or 4 seasons to get this team right because of how bad Cuban and Donnie had fucked it up. We on the right track now so we gotta just deal with it. It's a process."
21,[Marc Stein] League sources tell @TheSteinLine that Dallas is also acquiring Oklahoma City’s second-least favorable first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft this June to send to Washington in the Richaun Holmes-for-Daniel Gafford trade. Dallas adding PJ Washington and Gafford on deadline day.,
22,"A lot of us were Meh at first, but how do y'all feel about it now?",Also kept the Lakers poaches off our backs
23,Naji Marshall is the only signing out of the last 4 signings that isn’t from Texas or near it,"Nico Harrison seems to be prioritising players that are from the hometown. So they’re able to fit in the culture and feel appreciated homegrown talent. Gafford from Arkansas, PJ grew up in Texas, Quentin grimes is from Texas too.

All 3 new additions up until this point were from Texas. I think Naji is a culture fit, his hustle attitude and winning mentality will go a long way here."

25,How it started.....and how it's going,"As we are at the last few games of the season before Playoff time I was looking back at prediction posts on this sub for the 23-24 season. It was a mixed bag from anywhere between Top #3 seed to #6 to play in to missing the play in yet again. Looking at how this season has played out so far its pretty clear what direction we are trending.

The biggest questions before the season were around:

Can Luka & Kyrie play together? / Will Luka take that next step? / Can we close out games? / Is DP going to be our center, again? / Can this team compete in the west? / How are we going to address our lack of size and rebounding? / Etc

***Can Luka & Kyrie play together?*** YES. Plain and simple. Not only can they play together they are the deadliest 1 2 punch in the league averaging the most points from a Duo. And you get Luka in the 1st averaging 9.6 points and both in the 4th averaging 6.8 and 6.7 points. Individually they are a PROBLEM for most teams, together it is a tough task to guard either of them with any sort of effectiveness. Kyrie's ability to get to the basket and move the ball with absolute control for a bucket is a thing of beauty. Luka has gone back to finesse and fakes and creating separation vs the straight up Bully ball from last season.

***Will Luka take that next step?*** It's hard to even rationalize what a next step could look like from someone who averaged 32.4 / 8.6 / 8.0 last season. Well, Luka said ""Hold my beer"". Averaging 33.8 / 9.2 / 9.8 and leading the league in scoring. Not only is he up across the board but he improved his FT% and 3PT % and Steals. Checking all the boxes for MVP in the process (Top 4/5 seed, League Leader in a category, Min game threshold, etc).

***Can we close out games?*** You betcha we can. At 22-9 in Clutch games this season (2nd best in the NBA) we had a MASSIVE improvement from the last two seasons. Only 31 of our games so far have met the criteria for Clutch of 5pt game with 5mins to go. Last season, while we had the most clutch games at 55 or 67% of our games, our record was 26-29. The season before that we had 38 Clutch games with a record of 22-16. What does that mean? Whether we are up or down the 5 points we clamp it down and get it done this season.

***Is DP going to be our center, again?*** Nico, our mastermind GM, said NO. From the moves to get us DL to trading for The Landlord, we are a entirely different team post deadline and teams simply don't know how to guard us effectively now that we have the inside presence to go along with the 3pt shooting and Luka & Kyrie. We also, this season, finally win the tip off more often than not. Something that RARELY happened ever when DP was the starting tip. I know that sounds trivial but having a chance to score first does matter. There are a whole bunch of advanced stats to support this but I believe the winning % is like 52-53% when scoring first which 65% of those teams win the tip.

***Can this team compete in the west?*** Short answer, yes. Long answer, hell yes. Starting off 4-0 a lot of the media thought we would fade into the land of the play in and struggle there at best. Then we get hammered by injuries and slog through late November - January. Then we got healthy and guess what? Like the Jeffersons we have been ""moving on up"" the standings. We have had two 7 game winning streaks. We have had multiple 8-2 or 9-1 during a 10 game stretch and currently are 13-2 in our last 15. We are rebounding, playing D, blocking shots and starting to score from 3 consistently again. We have a ton of weapons and when used effectively (looking at you JKidd!!) we can be lethal.

***How are we going to address our lack of size and rebounding?*** Again, our man upstairs, Nico Harrison said, no problem, i've got this. Starting by drafting a starting center in Lively who has far exceeded rookie expectations. Trying for more interior defense and shooting he brought in Grant Williams. It obviously didn't work out but I love that he pulled the trigger to send him to Charlotte for a true Defensive scorer in PJail. Typically we would have held on to Grant for the whole season to ""see"" if it would eventually work out. It DID NOT. But man did we get a beast in PJ. His lock down D, his size and rebounding have been HUGE. And if his scoring is getting back into shape he is a dream come true. Speaking of dreams...THE LANDLORD. Gaffords presence inside is causing chaos on both sides of the court. Combined with Lively that is a massive upgrade at the center position and, potentially, 48 minutes of size, rebounding and PnR dunks. We have been competing or winning the points in the paint battle and rebounding battle in every game since the trade.

I haven't been this pumped about the post season in a long time. We are healthy, for the most part, and need to stay that way going into the playoffs. Get a few days rest while the Play In plays out and get ready for (as of now) The Clippers Part 3 - Revenge of the Doncic.

26,Something positive in this sub for a change,"With all the negativity and essentially same exact posts being put up constantly, I thought I would post something positive in this sub. Doomer fans, look away if you must.

1. Luka is a superstar and one of the very best players in the league. He's been doing this for a while now to the point where so many of us are used to it and just go eh when it comes to Luka. He averaged the most minutes per game for most of the season, dragged this team riddled with injuries in the first half of the season, improved his conditioning, plays more in transition and for the most part has been a solid defender and can really lock in when he wants to. He's been getting a lot of criticism and hate in this sub so I just wanted to recognize our glorious king and show him some appreciation. 
2. Kyrie is arguably the most talented player I've seen in the NBA. It's a sentiment shared by many but it's true. Best ball handler of all time, one of the best shot creators of all time, great shooter, and clutch. His injuries have been disappointing but when he's healthy, he's been great obviously and I love watching him play.
3. Mavs have a young core. The 2023 draft was HUGE for this season. For so long this team relied on veterans and while you obviously want veterans, you want youth as well. Youth that can contribute right away and be something big for the franchise in the future. Lively looks like a top 5 rookie when he's healthy. He's going to be an all-NBA defender for many years to come. OMax while obviously raw has a lot of upside and I believe can also be a all-nba defender if everything goes right. Josh Green gets forgotten about but he's been great and taking small steps every season; he's elite from the corner as well. 
4. Nico Harrison is a great GM. His execution of the 2023 draft was flawless. Trading for PJail and Landlord were great pieces to add to our defense and depth. We have a legit center rotation for the next few years at least. He's a GM who never rests and is always looking to improve the team in the present while also thinking about the future.

What are some other positive things about this team you'd like to share? Comment below."
