> • You also won’t see Jonathan Kuminga or Moses Moody, two young Golden State Warriors players who could be used to facilitate a deal for a star player. **I don’t think the Warriors have ruled out moving them, but my impression, at least currently, is that they aren’t actively including them** in potential trade packages either. **League sources believe new general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. values both at a very high level and would love to hold onto them if he can, even if he also understands one or both may need to be the mechanism to facilitate much-needed changes with the slumping Warriors.** It’s possible one or both of Kuminga and Moody feature on future iterations of this board, but that’s the reasoning I used to hold them off for now.

&nbsp;

> The general feeling around the league is that the Warriors are open for business and are willing to discuss a variety of different players to shake things up after a rough start to the season. However, Golden State is not enthusiastic about potentially moving youngsters Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody, according to league sources not authorized to speak publicly. **Neither is off the table if the right deal comes along, but it would be unfair to say they’re on the block at this stage**, even as the Warriors look to alter their roster.

Meanwhile, the **price tag on Markkanen is so high that it effectively takes him off the market**, especially with how well the Utah Jazz have played recently.

&nbsp;

### The Key Warriors' Stakeholders* understands the current roster isn't championship-caliber:

\* Key Warriors' Stakeholders = Mike Dunleavy Jr, Joe Lacob, Kirk Lacob

> Steve Kerr coached that team. Mike Dunleavy was in attendance. Draymond Green was roaring from the middle of the bleachers. Joe Lacob and Kirk Lacob followed from afar. The **key Warriors’ stakeholders grasp Curry’s sustained greatness and, team sources said, there is an internal understanding that his current supporting cast can’t be considered a finished product if the 2025 NBA championship is believed to be a reachable goal.**


&nbsp;

### Steph knows about everything and isn't concerned about the team (for now):

> Curry was in on the recruitment of George. Dunleavy keeps him in the loop on the options and ultimate personnel decisions. **Curry hasn’t, team sources said, expressed any signs of panic or unrest**. But there’s a choice of action or inaction in the coming months that’ll give a clearer hint about his long-term mindset.

&nbsp;

### Steph is taking a Post-Olympics break from basketball and won't talk about his potential 1-yr $62.6 mil extension til later:

> Curry is eligible for a one-year, $62.6 million extension to his contract, which has two seasons and $115.3 million left. He flew back from Paris a few days ago and **plans to unplug from basketball-related business for a few weeks. So any contract conversation isn’t expected to take place in the near future, league sources said. It’ll be entirely on Curry’s preferred timeline.** The deadline to extend is Oct. 21.

> From the Warriors’ side, it isn’t nearly as complicated as their more recent contract extensions or future. **If Curry wants to tack on that extra year anywhere up to that max of $62.6 million, the Warriors would be willing.** It’s a position they’ve maintained privately and publicly.

&nbsp;

### Warriors still believe they did Improve even if not championship-caliber (at least analytically):

> The Warriors **believe they improved this summer, team sources emphasized, basing that partially on internal number models that gave a positive-value thumbs-up** to the additions of Melton, Anderson and Hield. A **few analytics-driven employees from around the league agree. One rival’s metric model had Golden State fourth in the conference**. The Warriors’ 46 wins a season ago through turbulence stood only five back of the fifth spot (Clippers, 51 wins).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Some info on how far the Lauri Markannen trade talks (or even availability) actually went:

> Maybe Brandin Podziemski or the exact amount of firsts would’ve eventually been the swing factor in deeper Markkanen negotiations, sparking an internal debate. But **it never reached that stage, team sources said**. Markkanen signed an extension in Utah, and **several sources from multiple inquiring teams said they believe, in retrospect, this was always the Jazz’s intended outcome. Markkanen’s true availability was a mirage.**

23,[Golden State Warriors] Mike Dunleavy Jr. Speaks to Media Ahead of 2023-2024 Season (13:58),
24,Grading Every Warriors First Round Pick since 2000.,"Exactly what the title says. With the draft coming up and us NOT having a first overall pick I figured this would be a good time to reminisce on the highs and lows of our drafting history. Of course grades will be based not just on good the player is but how good they turned out based on when they were picked. I'm also including picks we acquired in draft day trades, but not players we picked and then traded away.

**2001 Pick #5 - Jason Richardson** Our franchise's first real hit in awhile. Never turned out to be a superstar but always good for a show. Good 3 point shooter, dunk contest champ who could absolutely go off once ever few games. Best pick would have been Joe Johnson. Grade - B

**2001 Pick #14 - Troy Murphy** Capable starting power forward. Averaged a double double which we haven't seen much since to be honest. Sadly he can't be called ""efficient"" or ""good at defense"" and we could've had Zach Randolph. Grade - C

**2002 Pick #3 - Mike Dunleavy** Let's hope Dunleavy turns out to be a better GM than he was a draft pick. Hopefully he wouldn't have drafted himself #3 because despite being a solid player this was a huge miss. Annoyingly him & Murphy both got better after going to Indiana. Should've taken Stoudemire. Grade - D

**2002 Pick #16 - Jiri Welsch** This was a Sixers pick we traded a future first and second for on draft night. Funny thing about this I can't find any evidence Philadelphia ever got that first and good thing too because Welsch sucked. He does get points for completely tanking Lebron & the Cavs 2005 season though. Grade - D-

**2003 Pick #11 - Mickael Pietrus** High-flying streaky shooter who had the unique ability to step out of bounds on step back 3's. Solid contributor to the We Believe Warriors but he should've been better than he was and we should've taken David West. Grade - C-

**2004 Pick #11 - Andris Biedrins** Fans who hopped on in the Curry era miiiight remember this guy. One minute he was an energetic double double and play finisher and then he just got the yips and fell out of the league way too early. I got fond memories of him but this was a meh pick. Grade - C+

**2005 Pick #9 - Ike Diogu** The first of two badly burned 9th overall picks. Respectable ability to get to the foul line and make them just about sums up the positives. Not only was Andrew Bynum, a center a million times better, taken right after but he basically sucked and couldn't even defend. Grade - D-

**2006 Pick #9 - Patrick O'Bryant** Averaged just 1.7 points per game for us mostly in garbage time. You could maaaaybe say Nellie never gave him a real chance to develop but honestly he was never any good anywhere. Grade - F

**2007 Pick #8 - Brandan Wright** A massive fail that really felt like we could never have anything good in the world. Coming off our best season since forever we traded the beloved Jason Richardson for this pick. The real fuckery of this trade is that this was supposed to be a blockbuster deal that landed us KG which would have meant a core of KG and the We Believe team with Don Nelson which would have been absolutely insane. But that bum Cohen didn't get the deal done and we wound up with a guy who never played 40 games in a season. Grade - F

**2007 Pick #18 - Marco Belinelli** - Turned out to a be a decent roleplayer who was a big contributor on some playoff teams throughout the 2010s. Didn't do much of anything with us but I'm blaming that on Nellie not knowing how to trust young guys, not the FO for picking a good player. Grade - C+

**2008 Pick #14 - Anthony Randolph** Another miss in our endless and ongoing search for a franchise big man. For those counting that's 4 wasted lottery picks in a row trying to upgrade at center if you count the Wright trade. In the dark days of the turn of the decade he had some good moments and did net us David Lee. Once again I think part of this is the Don Nelson effect and part of it is just talent never materializing. Grade - D+

**2009 Pick #7 - Stephen Curry** The best player to ever put on a Warriors jersey. Grade - A+++++++++++

**2010 Pick #6 - Ekpe Udoh** The last straw of big men being drafted for ""defensive potential"" and blowing up in our face. Not helping is that we could have taken Greg Monroe or, you know, Paul George. He was capable at least but this was the last real whiffed lottery pick of the dark ages. Helped us get Bogut at least. Grade - D-

**2011 Pick #11 - Klay Thompson** Top 5 shooter of all time arguably the 2nd best when you look at just how many damn threes he hit in such a short amount of time. Combine that with elite POA defense in his prime and a propensity for clutch baskets and you get a hall of famer. Grade - A+

**2012 Pick #7 - Harrison Barnes** Bit of a complicated legacy nowadays due to his truly disgraceful performance in the 2016 finals but we're still talking about a good player. The ""Ringo"" of the original Death Lineup he still played a massive role in why our small ball lineups were so good thanks to his defensive versatility and he did have a couple iconic clutch performances such as the clinching game 5 vs. Houston in 2015, and he deserves credit for being a big part of our rise to a dynasty. Grade - B-

**2012 Pick #30 - Festus Ezeli** Good backup big for a few years when he was healthy. It is kinda funny that from 2005-10 we took 5 centers with lottery picks and maybe 1 of them was as good as this guy we got for cheap. Minus points for injury issues though. Grade - C-

**2013 Pick #30 - Nemanja Nedovic** On draft day 2013 a bunch of teams wound up swapping late first rounders. We had Andre Roberson at one point but wound up turning him into Nedovic. People used to call him ""EuRose"" which... didn't work out. He did have a good preseason in 2014-15 but got cut for partying too much and fumbled the ring. Grade - D-

**2015 Pick #30 - Kevon Looney** We know and love Loondawg but it wasn't looking good for a minute. Injuries derailed his arrival to the league and after a breakout 2019 campaign kept him sidelined for much of the playoffs. But he finally got another chance in 2022 and turned into an offensive rebounding machine and invaluable piece to that championship team. Then went out and sonned Domantas Sabonis next year for good measure. He looks like he'll be done soon, but we're talking about a 30th overall who would be a lottery pick if you run the draft back. Grade - A-

**2016 Pick #30 - Damian Jones** Has carved out a respectable journeyman career but really never showed much of anything with us. Just took the right change of scenery I guess. Grade - D

**2018 Pick #28 - Jacob Evans** It's hard to call a 28th pick a ""bust"" but this guy is about as close as it gets. He just wasn't good at anything. If you saw him play you what I mean. Grade - F

**2019 Pick #28 - Jordan Poole** Has become a bit of a meme and really was hugely disappointing but again we need to look at the big picture. Picks this late are a massive crapshoot and if you get a guy who can be an absurdly efficient 17 PPG microwave scorer on a championship run, that's a win. Grade - B+

**2020 Pick #2 - James Wiseman** The biggest bust in franchise history. I'm not here to make this another Wiseman circlejerk we know the story at this point. Grade - F

**2021 Pick #7 - Jonathan Kuminga** Kuminga's career is still unfolding but so far this looks like a great pick. In his 3rd season he showed the potential as a ridiculously athletic 2-way forward with a 3 point shot. My biggest concern at this point is staying healthy. Grade - B- (so far)

**2021 Pick #14 - Moses Moody** Jury's still out on Moody and he seems like a high quality role player who's already shown the ability to step up in the playoffs. Definitely better than the 4 guys picked ahead of him but we probably should have taken Sengun. Grade - C

**2022 Pick #28 - Patrick Baldwin Jr.** Tiny sample size after being traded after 1 season so we can sort of give a grade here. He gave us some decent minutes to help turn around our 2023 season a little bit with our rotations in constant chaos but still didn't get enough opportunity to be called a hit pick. Grade - D+

**2023 Pick #19 - Brandin Podziemski** Too early to tell but this looks like it could our best pick in awhile. A rookie who was immediately able to play winning basketball and just has that veteran mindset. Needs to work on his shooting but that will come with the time. The scary thing is our 2nd rounder from this year may be even better. Grade - Incomplete (but will be A /s)"
25,[Slater] “Kings pressured the hell out of us. We didn’t have counters” was clearly front of mind for Kerr as he interviewed candidates...Kerr & FO decided to add 2 assistants with specific qualities — a former NBA head coach & a former NBA player. Kerr landed on Terry Stotts & Jerry Stackhouse,"[Source Article by The Athletic's Anthony Slater - ""Steve Kerr aims to bolster Warriors’ coaching staff in very specific ways""](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5634372/2024/07/16/steve-kerr-warriors-terry-stotts-jerry-stackhouse/)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### Kerr kept in mind the play-in loss vs Kings when deciding the new assistant coaches Terry Stotts & Jerry Stackhouse:

> “They pressured the hell out of us,” the Warriors head coach told The Athletic. “We didn’t have counters. We didn’t respond. And, you know, I’ve seen that more and more the last couple of years. The bigger the game, the more pressure defense we see and the tougher it’s been for us to execute.”

> That was clearly front of mind for Kerr as he interviewed assistant coaching candidates throughout June....To replenish a thinned bench, **Kerr and the Warriors’ front office decided to add two assistants with specific qualities to their staff — a former NBA head coach and a former NBA player.**

&nbsp;


### Why Kerr landed on Stotts:

> Despite a long history in the same industry, Kerr and Stotts didn’t know each other well before this hiring process. But the mutual respect was there and, as Kerr dissected the offensive issues that need fixing, it became clear to him that Stotts — a noted tactician — had the correct skill set to do the tweaking.

>“He **fits what we want to do and get a little bit more patterned,” Kerr said. “He loves movement. Portland, you know, they always had a lot of motion and movement, but it was probably more patterned than what we’ve done**. Terry can really help us put in some new things that may be easier to run but maintain the motion.”

&nbsp;

### Terry Stotts on the Warriors Offense & What he could bring:

> “They’ve had a great offense for a lot of years,” Stotts told The Athletic. “Steph’s been doing pretty well (laughs). I think I can maybe bring some fresh eyes to it. The roster has changed a little bit. **But it’s not like I’m going to be in charge of anything. I think I can be a good sounding board for Steve on the offensive end and might be able to implement some things we did in Portland.**”

>**Stotts was careful to reiterate that he doesn’t want to overhaul an offense that’ll still be built around Curry‘s and Draymond**  Green’s passingand off-ball strengths. The flow, movement and pet actions those two love will remain. But **there’s a rising layer of youth that would benefit from more structure.**

> “Everyone knows we ran a lot of flares and pindowns (in Portland),” Stotts said. “**I think the players we have will be good within that. Steve loves read and react. I think that’s the best way to play. But at the same time, you can put in a framework. What I like to have is — you can have a play call, but within that play call, you don’t know what’s going to happen**. You might have splits or flares or pindowns or pick-and-roll and that freedom within a structure.”

> Stotts used the “delay” play call as an example. It’s a five-out design with a big up-top initiating action and plenty of freedom to run various action around it, which can shift depending on personnel, an opponent’s defensive scheme or instinct within the moment. **This type of nuanced tweak is what appealed to Kerr.**

&nbsp;


### Kerr says the Offense will still mainly run through Steph & Dray, but will implement more 'Repeatable Patterns' via Stotts:

> “We’re not going to shift dramatically,” Kerr said. “**With Steph and Draymond, we’re always going to run a lot of things through those guys. And they’re going to play the way they play. But I do think that we can be, like I said, more patterned**. We have to practice more. Bottom line, we have to practice more. I’ve got to figure out a better way to streamline practice, get our actions over and over again into patterns so that we can execute better against pressure defense. … We’ve always been a team that has had to rely on execution and movement because we’re not a great one-on-one team. But with the group that we have now, I think we need more work and more repeatable patterns.”


&nbsp;

### Stotts on the Culture Fit:

> Kerr said everyone “raves” about Stotts and believes he will fit seamlessly into the staff’s culture.

> “Steve and I have had very few conversations before this,” Stotts said. “But **I’ve always had a lot of respect and admiration for what he has said from a basketball standpoint, from a coaching standpoint, from a social awareness standpoint. Intellectually, I’ve always had a lot of appreciation of how he represents himself**. That was certainly a big appeal to me.”


&nbsp;

### Stotts' Prior Connections to Key Members of the Org + the Org itself:

* Warriors assistant in 2004-05 under Mike Montgomery, coaching Year 3 Mike Dunleavy Jr
* Stotts worked on the same staff as Warriors assistant Ron Adams for four seasons in Milwaukee  beginning in the late 1990s
*Larry Harris, a current Warriors executive, hired Stotts to that Milwaukee staff

> Stotts and Stackhouse were having a conversation in Las Vegas when they remembered that Stotts actually coached Stackhouse during his final season in Dallas, one of the least memorable of his storied 18-year NBA career.

> “I was just talking to Ron about it,” Stotts said. “I’ve had the good fortune of working for three Hall of Fame coaches. George Karl is in the Hall of Fame. Mike Montgomery is Hall of Fame. Lon Krueger is Hall of Fame. Rick Carlisle will be in the Hall of Fame. Steve Kerr will be in the Hall of Fame. So I will have worked for five Hall of Fame coaches. That’s pretty cool.”


&nbsp;


### Why Kerr landed on Ex-Player Jerry Stackhouse for One of the Staff:

> “We’ve missed having a former player the last couple years,” Kerr said. “I love that he’s been a head coach at Vandy for five years. **He’s not only a former player, he’s a former All-Star. He commands respect**. He’s just got a really strong presence, and I think we needed that.”

-

> “Just feel like we needed Jerry,” Kerr said. “**We have a lot of young players. … There’s something about a former player where those guys can tell our players, ‘I’ve been there, I’ve done this. I know exactly what you’re going through.’ Jerry did it on a really high level**, but he’s also coached at a high level. That meant a lot to me.”

&nbsp;

### Current Front of the Coaching Bench:

> Stackhouse’s strategic work will be mostly on the defensive side. He’s expected to work with Chris DeMarco on that end, according to Kerr. Assistant coach Kris Weems will remain on the front of the bench next to Stotts and Stackhouse."
26,Steph's greatness really puts a horrible light on MDJ's disastrous two summers...,"tldr; MDJ and Lacob are absymal and absolutely clueless, and have ruined Steph's end-of-career years. 


## The road to this summer
After 2023 playoffs, it was clear that we needed a second star against the Lakers, and Steph was getting worn down. 

And MDJ after our playin loss earlier this year: 

> ""We know clearly what this team was: it wasn’t good enough.” Warriors can move forward with that clarity."" 

https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/1c7bros/emerman_mike_dunleavy_jr_we_know_clearly_what/

Yet, MDJ proceeds to poop all over our 2025 season by doing pretty much nothing. We swapped Klay for some decent low-talent pieces (like Melton/Slomo/Hield) and did squat all. 

# We are as clueless as the Bulls of 2023-24

1. We aren't good enough to even be a playoff team, yet we're stringing our GOAT along. 

2. And we're holding on to pretty much ALL our future picks as though we're in a rebuild. 

3. We dropped our best shot at a trade by tryna low-ball Ainge. All for a bench guy like Podz + a couple of future picks. 

4. Despite claiming that our team wasn't good enough, we are going in with practically the same team: (Klay/CP3/Saric out for Melton/Slomo/Hield)

### What now?

We now are entering 2024-25 season with pretty much the same roster as last year (probably a bit worse too, given Steph/Dray's age), and are holding on to picks as though we're in a rebuild. 

There's NO stars desperate for a move that will come up at the trade deadline. Also when we're 10 wins off the playoff spots in Feb, no trade can save us."
27,"Despite Slater, as recently as today, continuing to push the narrative that there's been ""little contact"" between Klay & the Warriors, here is Dunleavy in response to TK, again, trying to get specifics on negotiations w/Klay during an interview post-draft for TK's podcast.

Not much, if any, new info at all other than MDJ completely refuting Slater’s weeks-long narrative about the Warriors and Klay’s negotiations that “there remains…little contact between Thompson and the Warriors, league sources said, as the potential end of his 13-year run with the franchise becomes more plausible.”   "

It could theoretically be done in-season, though I’d expect serious discussions (and perhaps an agreement) to come before that.

### FO Determined to not be in the 2nd Apron by Next Season:

> The introduction of the second apron has made everything a little trickier. Beginning the following summer, if the Warriors are still into that second level of the tax bracket (where they currently live), they’ll be hit with a handful more punitive penalties, which include the loss of the mini midlevel exception, an inability to add buyout players in-season and frozen draft picks.

It was a core reason for the Poole-for-Chris Paul trade. Poole is owed $30.1 million for the 2024-25 season. Paul’s $30 million that season is fully non-guaranteed until June 28, able to be completely shed, if needed.

> This shifts the conversation to the exact financials that’ll get it done. Because the Warriors are unwilling to go into the second apron next summer, it puts an artificial cap on what they can offer Thompson. I asked our cap expert, Danny Leroux, to crunch some theoretical numbers to figure out how much they can offer Thompson while staying below the second apron.

> The Warriors currently have $142.1 million committed to nine players. Assuming Paul’s number is completely wiped off the books and they only fill the rest of the roster with Thompson and vet minimums 



&nbsp;

### No Worries about the Steve Kerr Extension (and negotiations will remain private):

> There isn’t as much to sort out financially as a year ago. Thompson isn’t alone. Steve Kerr also is entering the final year of his deal. But coaching salaries aren’t tied to the cap. Kerr has voiced a desire to be with the Warriors beyond this season. Ownership has indicated it wants to extend Kerr.

>Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Kerr are scheduled to meet with reporters to preview the season on Monday afternoon. Kerr has voiced a desire to keep negotiations private and out of the media, but he will assuredly be asked about his contract status.

>The dollar amount is up for bargaining. It’s a Kerr-friendly landscape. Monty Williams and Gregg Popovich just reset the coaching market with megadeals. Joe Lacob will need to pay up to retain Kerr, but it’s untaxed and untethered from the player salaries, leading to what should be a simpler negotiation."
32,Need time to process this loss,"It is probably the end of the dynasty as we know it. I know Steph and Dray and Kerr will all be back (maybe Klay too, but im only hopeful because of nostalgia which is not a good reason to re-sign a player like Klay with his recent postseason record but thats a different story) but it will be different. I’m glad the season is done because, having watched all 82 games, this season was a crazy rollercoaster. But at the same time, I want Steph Curry to win one more ring. Many things went wrong here, starting with the FO for poor roster construction although I understand the salary cap limits. 

But I’m not yet ready to end it all. Steph is not some glorified Ray Allen yet. 

One last dance next year, I hope."
33,Warriors Trade Deadline Plan (personal opinion),"For me as a fan of GS since 2012, would look at the free agents first available. To be realistic, I wont trade Steph, Klay, Draymond, BP, TJD, Kuminga, Moody, Saric. Here's what I would do if I were in the chair of Mike Dunleavy Jr. Lemme know what you think since im posting for the first time on the dubs for the trade deadline and hello this is my first post here.   


(I just realized how harsh NBA reddits are)

Potential Trade Targets:

* Pascal Siakam
* Christian Wood (not doing well so he's out of the list)
* Clint Capela
* Zach LaVine
* Gabe Vincent (I just realized he's injured)  


**Roster Moves:**

* Sign JTA for the vibes
* Sign Nerlens Noel. (WHY Y'ALLL DONT WANT EM)

Couple edits:  
First trade Wiggins for Siakam. I would go for a Capela trade since size is everything, if you want a solid second option go for LaVine.  


NOTE THIS IS A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT"
34,Mike Dunleavy in his first year of GM: Turned Poole into CP3 and attempted to trade for Lebron James,
35,"[Slater] Steph Curry is eligible to extend an extra year this summer. Mike Dunleavy: “That guy, whatever he wants…Pretty confident he will be a Warrior for life.” Dunleavy also said the desire is to extend Kuminga/Moody (0:50)",
36,"[Slater] Mike Dunleavy said Jonathan Kuminga was ""virtually"" untouchable in trade talks: ""As untouchable as guys can be in this league. Didn't see a scenario where Jonathan wouldn't be on our team after this deadline.""",
37,[Dalton Johnson] Mike Dunleavy says “internal development” has to be the Warriors’ priority to improve first and foremost  “It’s so hard to make a trade in today’s NBA ... if it happens great.” Dunleavy made it clear they can’t put all their eggs in that basket,
38,"[Slater] Steve Kerr will not coach the Warriors tonight in Utah. He is in Serbia for Dejan Milojevic’s services. Kenny Atkinson will be the acting head coach. Also in Serbia for the service: Mike Dunleavy, Chris DeMarco, Ron Adams, Zaza Pachulia, Rick Celebrini.",

41,"[Slater] The Warriors veterans (Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson) have set up player workouts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Francisco this summer.

42,"[Slater] Mike Dunleavy on the Hield/Anderson/Melton additions and the concern about the shooting on the roster. “In terms of volume and accuracy, we need guys to shoot the 3 more. Moses, Wiggs, BP, JK, all those guys I think can make shots.” (1:35)",
43,"[Andrews] Speaking with reporters here in Vegas, Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy says “I can’t reiterate what an unbelievable run (Klay Thompson) had. We’ll miss him. But life goes on and I think he’s in a good spot.”",
44,"[Slater] Here is Mike Dunleavy on the Warriors’ financial equation entering the summer and the desire to keep Klay Thompson. Dunleavy said there is no directive to duck the luxury tax, but it is unreasonable to pay $400 million for a non-playoff team. (1:42)",
45,[Warriors on NBCS] Mike Dunleavy explains the process behind trading the No. 52 pick and then reacquiring it ,

49,"[Slater on 95.7] ""They don't want to trade [Podziemski]. He's beloved organizationally...One of the rare aspects to him, compared to the Warriors' other recent picks, is Steve Kerr couldn't keep him off the floor as a rookie.""",
50,[Slater] Mike Dunleavy on the Warriors hard-capping themselves at the second apron ($189.5 million) “We were aware of what (the draft trade) did…To stay under the second apron is plenty of money to spend to build a good team.” (0:26),
51,[Slater] Mike Dunleavy on Draymond Green in the wake of this latest incident. Green is on year 1 of a four-year deal. “We’re committed to him.” (1:22),
52,[Slater] Mike Dunleavy said “it’s possible” the Warriors and Chris Paul push back his $30 million guarantee date. It is tomorrow. “We’ve got another 24 hours” (0:47),
53,[Slater] Mike Dunleavy said Draymond Green will be around the Warriors during his suspension and eligible to practice: “We think the healthiest thing is for him to be around. It may not be every day but we are not jettisoning the guy off somewhere.” (1:39),

63,"Lots of positivity on this sub this past week, but tonight is the real test","We went on  a 5 game winning streak earlier in the season too defeating shit teams like Portland and the Spurs. Then came back to reality soon after.

We just had a similar stretch, but can we keep up the momentum this time or are we gonna get humbled again and a bunch of people gonna be shitting on MDA for not making moves at the deadline.

The Suns have all their big 3 tonight and it will be a real test for us"
64,Do you think we'll see if age will affect Curry to some degree next season or not?,"I don't expect a big drop off but I am curious to see how he does with the new roster. For certain he can't carry the team and rely on him to save us. That's why its so important to get help. We'll really get a better understanding of where he's at and help his longevity. 

I do think last year Curry was just tired from having no help than actual age but that can't be an issue anymore. If Curry gets help I hope he's rejuvenated . If he looks tired with help still that's when I'd start to worry."
65,Having our cake and eating it too: My ideal warriors offseason.,"**First thing's first**

You can't trade JK. Extending him is a no brainer to me. Whether it's likely or not,  he is our best bet for a post-Curry superstar. Giving him the max extension lets us test that theory. The reality is we need to keep Kuminga *and* add talent. Does turning Kuminga + Chris Paul into Brandon Ingram really make us contenders? That will just lock us into mediocrity with no way of improving. Free agency is the solution to our number one issue:

**Not enough top end talent.**

Too much talent was wasted on a deep bench. There are only 240 minutes to go round in an NBA game. We need to allocate them as efficiently as possible.

Steph, Draymond, and Kuminga should be locked in for 32 minutes each. That leaves 144. If you assume a minimum of 25 each for Moody, TJD, and Podz, that's 69 remaining. Guys like Looney and GP2 will probably get 10 or so each per night, which puts you at 49 minutes, enough for two more additions.

That's a 32 minute starter, and a solid rotation bench player for the other 17-ish minutes.

**So who can we get?**

* Next year's cap is \~$141m, with the tax at $171m
* If we let CP and Klay both walk, that's \~$77m off the books.
* If we can get off Wiggins (someone with space should be willing to absorb his contract in return for a future first), that's > $100m in salary gone, giving us \~$23m in space. Not enough to get us that alpha we need to get back to title contention.

**BUT**

* If GP2 is willing to opt out and renegotiate, that's another $9m, and you can resign him with Bird rights after you're done spending.  So now we're at \~$32m in cap space.
* If we waive the non-guaranteed contracts of guys like Gui, Quiñones, Garuba , that's well over $35m freed up, and you can even get another $5m if you waive Looney (only $3m of $8m guaranteed).
* I believe we can still re-sign these guys to the contracts they were expecting *after* we're done spending (if they want to stay).

That's a lot of cash that can be freed up to spend on a single player. Who might we get with that? **Paul George** has a player option and may want out of LA if the Clippers don't make a run. At 34, he might value the financial security of 4y/$160m and a shot to play with Curry and finally get a ring.

* Say that deal starts at $35m in Y1.
* You resign all those young guys for their minimum contracts.
* To keep things simple, you bring back GP2 a at the same price and just add a year (in reality we'd probably get a discount for adding years, maybe 3y/$21m or something).

Now you're at \~$155m total and you *still* haven't used the NTPMLE, a \~$14m slot you can use to either bring back Klay (if he's willing to take the pay cut) or go get someone else who better fits your composition.

My guess is that NTPMLE would not be enough to get Klay back. Thank you for your service. That lets us address some of our glaring weaknesses:

**1. Point of attack offense.**

We need someone who can make defenses pay for doubling Steph off the ball by putting pressure on the defense to collapse. This year it was too easy for defenses to get away with doubling Steph away from the ball, which brings the whole offense to a screeching halt. With the addition of PG, and enough improvement from JK we may be set in this department. Even Podz could help out here from the bench. He might not be explosive, but I can see his craftiness and poise as a great change of pace way to break down defenses. If we still don't feel fully loaded, maybe we offer the full exception to **Malik Monk**.

**2. Perimeter defense**

When you can't keep anyone in front of you, the defense collapses to help, and you give up wide open threes. It's not bad luck that all these teams had their best shooting nights against us. We couldn't guard.

Better perimeter defense would be great. PG obviously helps a ton here as well. But I think there are better solutions to this problem:

1. Be younger

This is kinda addition by subtraction. CP and Klay spent 56+ minutes a night getting beat over screens by younger, quicker shooters. This deficiency was never more apparent than against the Kings in the play-in. Without Monk + Huerter, the Dubs had to know that Murray going off was the key to Sacramento winning, and yet he went off anyway.

Murray's a stud with a great future, but if you can't keep a young role player from absolutely torching you in an elimination game when your opponent is missing two of its most important peripheral scorers, something is *very* wrong.

Simply having younger, more athletic defenders willing to fight through screens and catch up after getting beat will make it that much harder for opposing shooters to get the easy looks we gave up all year. Remaining out on shooters will have the knock on effect of improving team rebounding. Collapsing gives the offense tons of space to crash the boards. Boxing your man out is much easier when you're physically close to him (go figure) and makes the team effort much less chaotic.

2. More rim protection

Having a shot blocker you can trust to erase these mistakes makes it safer for perimeter defenders to stay with their man when someone gets beat off the dribble. TJD started to play this role really well toward the end of the season. I expect we'll lean on him more and more as the starting center next year. Finding bigs that work in our system has always been challenging, and I love Looney, but he's not someone I really want to rely on night in and night out. But A guy like **Jalen Smith** would give us a stretch four/small ball five who can block shots without sacrificing spacing.

At this point, you've got this lineup:

|PG|SG|SF|PF|C|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Steph|Paul George|Kuminga|Draymond|TJD|
|Podziemski|Moody|GP2|Jalen Smith|Looney|

It's obviously a long shot that it works out exactly this way (good thing the Mavs just stole game 2 in LA!!)

While I think PG would be the ideal fit on this team, there are other options that still keep the window open if you can pry them away in free agency. None are likely, but that's where GM's get paid. Say what you want about Dunleavy, he did a pretty good job getting off Poole's contract, bringing harmony back to the locker room, and picking up some incredible values in the draft. We know people like playing with Steph, but this is the first time since Durant left that we've had cap room to give anyone of that caliber the chance to join the team.

To me, it's a matter of will, not luck. Hell, maybe you pick Bronnie Jr in the 2nd round and get a couple years of LeBron instead of four with an aging PG.

But back to my hypothetical of choice: To me, that is a better distribution of talent, and while the roster isn't *that* different, the minutes are largely played by younger, more athletic players. You're betting on a lot of things here, but what is really encouraging is that this roster can contend while still being **under** the luxury tax, something we know the front office is gonna do.

**How does it play out on the court?**

Most nights Kuminga does the driving, and the team probably struggles early on while he finds his inner alpha. If you start to lose confidence, you give the keys to PG and make Kuminga the secondary look. By building the offense around Kuminga, the team can lean on young legs, letting Curry pick his spots and save his energy for those classic scoring infernos instead of killing the shot clock waiting for him to fight through off-ball double teams every possession. Best of all, you have PG there to dump the ball to when you *know* you need to get a shot off.

**How does it end? - Worst case scenario:**

Now you give Kuminga his max, extend Moody, and go back into the tax in '25-26. Worst case scenario, we don't make the post season run we were hoping for. Maybe someone gets hurt, and the lack of depth kills us.

Even if Kuminga doesn't end up taking up Curry's mantle --and if we're being honest, this is the more likely outcome-- then I'd argue we're still better off than if we had traded him for an older star in the first place.

* We'll have fielded a competitive roster for the final years of Curry's contract without giving up other assets just to fill the cap space we were able to spend on the free agent market anyway.
* We got to make the bet on Kuminga ourselves, which is just more satisfying to do with home-grown talent.
* Cap relief immediately follows after Curry's $60m expires after this two season experiment, and Curry can decide whether to keep pushing for it, sign for a discount, or go a different direction, which allows the team tear it down, hoard picks, and tank like everyone else.

**How does it end? - Best case scenario:**

We did right by Curry, surrounded him with guys who could get him back to the promise land, and he delivers for two more epic post season runs, and maybe even a ring or two if we're lucky.

By the time Curry/PG/Draymond are in full decline, the Kuminga investment is fully paying off, as the burgeoning superstar takes the reigns with a mature supporting cast of younger players that make it easy for the older guys to take nights off and contribute in reduced roles/salaries.

**In conclusion**

Even if my pie in the sky hypothetical doesn't pan out, I do hope we bet on Kuminga, and that we commit the minutes freed up by any departing players to the youth and potential already on the team. Make the big jump to contention by getting a big free agent on the market, rather than trading our exciting young core just to land a B-list max contract player who will likely struggle with a stale, aging supporting cast.

If ownership is satisfied getting under the tax just to run it back with the same roster, then that will be the biggest slap in the face to Curry that I can think of.

If they think creatively and communicate well, they can do right by everyone (fans included). I'd love to see them make an earnest offer to Klay of the full NTPMLE and congratulate him for landing a bigger offer if he gets one elsewhere.

  
**EDIT** - Since writing this I have learned a bit more about cap holds and Bird rights. It's still possible to free up \~$35m in cap space, but it would take a lot more work than I originally thought, and would require finding replacements for Looney and GP2 as well. I'm not sure how feasible that all is. 

In this case it seems to me that unless they got some kind of signal from PG that he wanted to go there, they would be more likely to just improve on the margins, bringing Klay back on Bird rights, adding a NTPMLE, maybe trading CP3 for a cheaper rotation 4 that would keep you under the tax. I don't think this would make us contenders, and still I don't think anyone we could bring back for Kuminga + CP3 would be better than Kuminga + whoever we can get on the market."
66,"[Slater] Jerry Stackhouse's defensive philosophy: “When you’re at this level, it’s about pride. I never wanted to be in a film session constantly having my name called for not doing what’s right. That’s the approach that I want to take...give these guys principles & techniques to adhere to”","[Source Article by The Athletic's Anthony Slater - ""For Jerry Stackhouse, chance to join Warriors’ coaching staff came at ‘perfect’ time""](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5658907/2024/07/26/jerry-stackhouse-warriors-coaching-staff/)

&nbsp;

### Jerry Stackhouse planned to take a year to evaluate which NBA team to join until MDJ & Kerr called first:

> “I don’t think the timing could’ve been more perfect for me,” Stackhouse told The Athletic. “If I would’ve fulfilled my (Vanderbilt) contract, I would’ve been nine, 10 years removed from the NBA.”

>Stackhouse took over a struggling Vanderbilt program and led them to 19 wins during the 2021-22 season and 22 wins the following season. He coached future pros Saben Lee, Aaron Nesmith and Scotty Pippen Jr. This past season, the Commodores, crunched by injuries, sputtered to a 9-23 record, and Stackhouse was let go. He assumed he’d sit out the next season and planned to travel to visit various pro coaching staffs, eyeing a return to the NBA level after beginning his coaching career in the Toronto Raptors organization.

> **“Golden State would’ve been atop my list,” Stackhouse said. “I would’ve called and wanted to come to training camp, come to practices.” But the Warriors called first. Dunleavy and Kerr set up an interview. Stackhouse impressed Kerr.**


&nbsp;


### Steve Kerr on what Stackhouse brings as a former player + Stackhouse on playing vs Kerr:

> He will take on a prominent role helping to organize and run the Warriors’ defense, and **he brought some ideas to the interview**.

> “**There’s something about a former player where those guys can tell our players, ‘I’ve been there, I’ve done this. I know exactly what you’re going through,**'” Kerr said. “Jerry did it on a really high level, but he’s also coached at a high level. That meant a lot to me.”

-

> “Just remember getting our asses kicked a lot,” Stackhouse laughed. “**We’ve always been very cordial**, even when he was doing broadcasting. I think **he’s always had respect for what I brought to the table, and I’ve had respect for what he’s been able to accomplish as a player and coach. One of the best to ever do it,** if you really look at it.”



&nbsp;

### Stackhouse's Hiring not only for Defense, but to help Develop the Wings as well:

> Stackhouse was in Las Vegas during the early portion of summer league. **He met veterans such as Jonathan Kuminga and Kevon Looney. He attended workouts for Andrew Wiggins and Moses Moody.** He made it clear he believes part of the reason **he was hired was to help develop all the wings** on the roster.

>“**That’s the position I played**,” Stackhouse said. “**I’ve sat in that seat. I’ve been there**. I understand what they’re going through, from a young guy looking for a contract to a guy whose game is transitioning as you get older. I’m an 18-year veteran. **Hopefully, I can come in and help motivate and inspire and help these guys take the next step** and take advantage of these years with Steph and Draymond (Green), maximizing the back end of their careers.”

### Stackhouse's Defensive Philosophy:

> “When you’re at this level, **it’s about pride**,” Stackhouse said. “**I was a guy that never wanted to be in a film session constantly having my name called for not doing what’s right. That’s the approach that I want to take**. … From the defense standpoint, **give these guys principles and techniques to adhere to and be able to judge them for those things** once we establish what they are.”

-

>**Stackhouse didn’t get into grand detail about his nuanced defensive philosophy, saying it’ll be a staff-wide project tied to personnel,** and a full playing-style conversation won’t happen until the coaches convene closer to training camp

&nbsp;

### Stackhouse on Close Outs & Blow-bys:

> “For me, **it’s about closing out to the touch without blow-bys to the basket. Those kill you, as well,**” Stackhouse said. “It’s finding a **happy medium. Close out with a hand in the air. Stick (out a) hand to deter shots. The numbers are there. Shots with a hand in the air miss more often than ones without a hand. It’s not an overhaul. It’s subtle things**, and it’s holding those standards game to game and possession to possession.”

&nbsp;

### Stackhouse on Transition Defense (plus Steph's effect):

> The Warriors’ defense particularly was vulnerable in transition last season, an area Kerr was regularly critical when asked to identify the biggest reason for many losses.

>“We have one of the most prolific scorers ever, prolific 3-point shooters,” Stackhouse said. “So **you know there’s going to be shots that may be unexpected or high degree of difficulty. You have to identify it quickly and get the floor balanced to protect against the transition** the other way.”




&nbsp;


### How Jerry Stackhouse can help Draymond Green:

> **Part of the Stackhouse hire, Kerr said, is about bringing a booming voice into the room. His relationship with Green should help keep both the defense and Green on track**. Stackhouse’s two All-Star seasons came in 2000 and 2001 for the Detroit Pistons when Green was growing up a couple hours up the road in Saginaw...**They linked up for a conversation in Las Vegas during the early days of summer league**.

>“**I think we’re kind of cut from the same cloth as far as competing and kind of having an edge**,” Stackhouse said. “How he approaches defense and the things he does plays well into how I want us to guard individually and the technique and the toughness. It kind of goes a long way when you have somebody who exudes all of those things.”

> They need Green to remain on the court where he can clean up a mess but also help Stackhouse and the rest of the coaching staff light into anyone who is causing a mess."
67,"[Slater] Chris Paul is not retiring. He will play a 20th NBA season somewhere. “I’ll talk to my wife and my kids, my family, my support system, see what it looks like,” Paul told The Athletic. “But this isn’t (the end of my career). I know it for sure.” Paul’s future with the Warriors is uncertain","[Source Article by The Athletic's Anthony Slater - ""Chris Paul said he isn’t retiring, but is there any future with the Warriors?/""](https://theathletic.com/5421426/2024/04/17/chris-paul-retirements-warriors-future-nba/)

&nbsp;

### Chris Paul isn't Retiring and Plans to play another season (whether with the Dubs or not):

> Later that night, the Sacramento Kings blow them out 118-94, an elimination that also throws into question Paul’s immediate future. But this much is clear: Paul is not retiring. He will play a 20th NBA season somewhere.

> **“I’ll talk to my wife and my kids, my family, my support system, see what it looks like,” Paul told The Athletic. “But this isn’t (the end of my career). I know it for sure.”**

> So **Paul’s future with the Warriors is as uncertain** (and perhaps more unlikely) than any other player who left the locker room late Tuesday night.

&nbsp;

### CP3 Appreciated the Open Communication & Family-friendly Culture of the Warriors Org:

>“I haven’t thought about it,” Paul said. “I’m too in it. I was in the gym at 8 a.m. this morning, lifting and getting ready for this game. When it’s time for that, Mike (Dunleavy) and Steve (Kerr), we’ll have a conversation and see what it looks like. But I loved it. It’s honestly — **this is my fifth year living without my family — I probably saw them more than any other year.”**

> That’s because of the proximity to Los Angeles, but also because of Kerr’s open culture. Families are welcomed into the interior of the Warriors’ building and around the team more than is typical in the NBA.

> “That’s probably what I appreciated the most out of everything is just the communication of letting me know when days are going to be off,” Paul said. “**Then your family can fly on the team plane like, I ain’t seen that. I’m grateful to Steve for that.”**

&nbsp;


### CP3 talks about his Initial Thoughts on the trade + Reactions of his inner circle:

> “I didn’t expect it to be bad,” Paul said. “When the trade happened, I was excited, I was energized. It’s been really cool to see all the basketball knowledge, the way different guys approach every day. When people ask about my experience here, I tell them I sort of got a chance to peek behind the curtain.”

> Paul’s inner circle showed varying forms of shock and apprehension after he joined the Warriors, his heated conference rival the previous decade. There’d been so many competitive dust-ups and heated playoff nights between the sides. But Paul embraced it quickly, believing in the shared traits between the sides.

-

> Trevor Ariza happened to be in LA (*after recent Lakers game*). Paul told Ariza to hop on their plane. Ariza was a part of those Houston Rockets teams. He knows how heated the rivalry became between Paul and the Warriors, how much Paul stewed over the losses, and how the Warriors taunted after the wins. “He was sitting in the plane like, ‘Man, I would have never thought…'” Paul said. “‘I would’ve never thought we’d all be on here together.'”

&nbsp;

### CP3 on forming a relationship with Klay & Dray:

> “I got so many (former teammates) in my career that, like, I have no relationship with,” Paul said. “Don’t really care to or anything like that. Or people who don’t like me or whatever. That don’t keep me up at night. But I’m grateful that I got a chance to be here with these guys. **Me and Steph were already connected. Me and Dray definitely, you know, got a real connection now. And somebody I’m grateful that I really got a chance to know is Klay.”**


&nbsp;

### Loved his time with the Warriors on a personal level, but maybe not as much on the basketball level:

> Paul understands the business better than just about any other current player. He knows his contract setup, the Warriors’ tax crunch and will be in on the conversations that dictate his 2024-25 NBA home. **He says he loved his time with the Warriors on a personal level. But there’s the basketball side that also complicates the equation**. Paul isn’t necessarily ready to just accept a lower-usage backup point guard role for the final seasons of his career. He remains of the belief that he can still run a team on a high-minute basis.

> “I try to do the most with the opportunity that was given,” Paul said. “**For me, it’s always been about winning, whatever that looks like. But I know I got a lot more to give to the game.** The situation is what it is. But I’ve loved every bit about (this season). I’ve loved every bit of it. Getting a chance to compete with these guys.”


> Paul fit perfectly as Stephen Curry’s backup point guard. Kerr struggled to find usable lineups with both Curry and Paul on the floor because of the size disadvantage, especially with Thompson also out there. “It’s a difficult situation for him that he handled beautifully,” Kerr said. “He’s always been the starting point guard for his team. But you look at our team and we’re pretty small. Even though he’s one of our best players, if we want to throw our best players out there — and he’s one of them — you start adding up Chris, Steph, Klay, it’s not the ideal roster for him. *Not the ideal roster for him*. That’s the subsection of that Kerr quote that probably hits the hardest. But he still desires more and his on-court impact and production and market could justify that, making a reunion unlikely."
68,[Rubin] Steve Kerr said he and Spoelstra texted each other on draft night about Jaquez (18th) and Podziemski (19th) picks: “We both said the same thing. We said ‘I love the guy you got.’ … They really liked Brandin and we really liked Jaime.”,
69,Dunleavy is our Jerry Krause,"Bob left because he knew the end was near.  He was too close to the players.  Too emotionally attached.  He knew that when it became time, he would have a hard time dismantling the core.

Mike hasn't been around as long.  He's relatively new.  He's a former scout.  He is not emotionally attached.  He is not close to the players.  We don't see him calming down Draymond when things get heated.  We don't see him talk about the players the way Bob does.  He's a calculating business man and that's it.

That business or corporate quality to him, makes him the perfect person to see the core out the door.  He's our Jerry Krause.

We should expect to see the same for the rest of the remaining core's tenure.  If Curry wants to play a year longer, expect a tough negotiation.  Maybe Steph leaves for a final year as well.  Who knows.  But Mike isn't attached."
70,It’s true lol they’re in a league of their own 🫡😂,
71,"[Slater] GSW’s lead decision-makers believe Curry’s longevity gives them a couple more seasons. If there’s a path to LeBron, Giannis (dream scenario) PG or KD, they will explore it. But, as a Warriors source reiterated, sometimes “simpler to develop a star wing than acquire one that isn’t available”",
72,"Going through Moody’s game tape, I came across this really cool sequence of passes going from Klay to TJD to Moody to lay it up. I’ve watched it so many times & I still can’t figure out how TJD saw Moody cutting to know how to perfectly angle the inside pass to him. His peripheral vision is absurd 😂",

"
74,"[ Anthony Slater via The Athletic] “But his decision, as one source put it, became easy when the Warriors kicked him down the summer pecking order…There was little communication between Thompson, the Warriors and Thompson’s agent, Greg Lawrence, and ultimately no offer in this cycle…“","continued “Many league sources said Thompson's decision to depart was unofficially made weeks ago.”


Was also mentioned how Kerr was still intending on bringing Klay off the bench if he were to return "
75,Every Loss Makes Things Easier,"It's almost like after every loss, we've been saying ""this is the worst loss of the season"" and somehow, it gets topped and repeated after every game we play. The only positive we can take from all of this is that these losses makes Mike Dunleavy's and management's jobs easier to make a move. There's no way in hell we're competing with anyone in the West with the way this roster is currently constructed. We just lost to the Grizzlies' G-League roster, missing their best two players on National TV, embarrassing. Moves are coming sooner rather than later, make it happen Mike!"
76,If Super Splash Bros. was a video game,
77,"Re Kerr, Just Stop","Y’all need to take a breath, think back, and give Kerr credit where credit is due. He led them to that first championship. Started Dray over Lee (bold ass move) and developed an offense specifically designed to maximize the strengths of curry and then maximized the way the others play around him so they could not only win but dominate.  He got Mike Brown because he knew he wasn’t a great defensive coach 1-2 years later.  Sure. The Durant years were boring as hell. No one did anything but play street ball and they still easily repeated and would have three peated if not for injuries.  

And the next two years sucked.  But what did we learn then?  He was forced to develop young players for 2 years.  Those years we got Poole, Kuminga, Moody, Wiseman.  Poole was a critical as we all know. He was fantastic. Then…the dray thing.  Kuminga and Moody are still here, both having their 3rd year leap. 

Now after two years of that, the band came back together.  There was little belief they would win a championship. They were “cooked” remember?  Many of you said it then. I thought so too. 

Remember, Wiggins did not start well that year.  Had a bit of a reputation. Klay wasn’t around.  Poole was starter caliber but young.  Kerr then took THAT team to ANOTHER championship.  That is fucking unreal. I credit the entire team AND the coach.  What a crazy year that was. 

So here we are. 

He can develop players ok but he’s better at winning championships. That is all he has ever known. He’s been around too much greatness. 9 rings. That’s some crazy shit. He is one smart and zen dude. But he needs a contending team. Not one stuffed to the gills with super young talent and too many of them.  Then at the same time have one of his best starters regress to garbage and another go berserk. He has probably one of the toughest assignments this year because of this mess. A PLAYER and ROSTER mess that he has to figure out every other day. 

Give the man a contending team and they will do magic.  He has only known contending. As a player and a coach. He has been around much greatness and he can do that again but the roster has to be able to contend at least. 

So Dunleavy needs to fix it.

Edit: corrected Lee / west. "
78,"[Medina] Dunleavy: ""The question as to whether we’ll be aggressive, you have to be open to see things & look at everything. If something makes sense, you do it. But I would never do something just to do something. We’ve been able to look out for our long-term salary spending & acquire good players”",
79,"[Andrews] The day before, Klay Thompson had Milojevic's son, Nikola, rebound for him following practice. ""Just to be able to tell him how much I loved his dad, all the great memories we built and made together, I just told him how grateful I am for his family and how proud of them he was""",
