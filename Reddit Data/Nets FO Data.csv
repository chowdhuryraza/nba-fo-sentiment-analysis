That concept was quickly dismissed with the Nets preferring to pursue a playoff or Eastern Conference play-in spot than to lose their way to a stronger first-round pick this season. Though reports were that the Rockets were interested in trading Jalen Green or in acquiring Mikal Bridges, the Rockets’ primary goal was — and still is — to move their collection of draft assets back."""
33,It's time to nuke the Nets,"Let me get this off my chest. I watch basically every game. I've posted on and off here since the sub started. 


**The Good Times**

Hear me out on Sean Marks:

The Prokohov era was extremely bleak. Even when we were a 2nd round playoff team, we were playing a selfish, leaderless brand of basketball, and there were constant rumblings the team resented each other. As more info has come out over the years, it seems like Brook and Iso Joe were the only two who kept their cool. 

Sean took the scraps of that era and a terrible team culture, and built a legit franchise with a bunch of late first rounders and G-league castaways. If y'all remember, Prokohov and Sean immediately had tension around Prokohov's ""win now, give up the farm"" philosophy. Sean wanted to be patient. 

Sean built a staff with elite player development. Kenny and co. turned Brook into Splash mountain, gave D'Lo the best years of his career, transformed borderline guys like Dinwiddie and Joe Harris into legit NBA starters. Resurrected the careers of guys on perceived shit contracts like Demarre Carroll.

Sean went on a sick run of drafts: Caris at the end of the 1st, Jarrett Allen at 22, Clax (and even Kurucs) at the end of the 2nd.

Then, the opportunity presents itself. KD, Kyrie, Harden. We send it.

**The Bad**

Borderline *nothing* since then makes any fucking sense. 

A first for Shamet. As much as we love Royce, a first for him was a head-scratcher. 

The *only* silver lining is Sean continues to crush finding value in the draft- CT and Dayron late in the 1st, and Jalen Wilson at 51 is cracked. 

The coaching debacle: as much as we lamented Kenny's rotations back in the day, he has *nothing* on the sort of dogshit we've seen since. Nash and JV's rotation decisions, timeout usage, etc is incoherent, got Nash canned fast, and is a constant source of frustration for the fans and players.

If there is even an inkling of truth in the rumors that we declined getting even a couple of our picks back from Houston for Mikal, nuke everything.

JV has lost the lockerroom. A bought-in team, no matter how talentless, does not lose by 50. Period. Schroeder seems cool, but he can't singlehandedly repair this bombed out franchise.

**SO WHAT NOW**

Is this Sean's masterplan? Sticking to a core of Mikal and CT to sell tickets? Attempting to soft-rebuild as a play-in team? Then can him. He's an amazing drafter, wherever he lands, they'll be stoked with his talent evaluation in the later stages of the draft. But it is criminal to get the return he got for Harden, and to stand by JV and this roster. 


Is all of this Joe Tsai in Sean's ear? If so, Sean needs to smack Joe's tiny ass upside the head and dunk him in ice water- I believe in the late 2010's Sean, not whatever the fuck we're seeing now. 

WHOEVER IT IS, IF IT'S ALL OF THEM, GET THEM ALL OUT. We're losing the only thing we've had going for us in the Marks/Tsai era- our reputation as a competent, well-staffed organization. If we're making fucking KYRIE look vindicated AT ALL then there is a problem. Fuck that guy, fuck this team, blow it up. Find whoever is responsible and take them out back."
34,Cam Thomas on finding out about Jacque Vaughn being fired :,"""I thought it was like a prank or something, then Sean [Marks] called and informed me. It's unfortunate... You don't wanna see nobody lose their job at the end of the day. It's tough."""
35,The Harden trade changed me as a Nets fan,"I was a ride or die Nets fan since the Kerry Kittles days. 12-70 was dismal, but I never felt embarrassed to root for this team. This year is the first time I’m ashamed to call myself a Nets fan. And the turning point for me was the Harden trade.

I hear a lot of Nets fans call the Harden trade a no-brainer. Say they would do it again ten times over. Fair position. But not only do I hate it now, I hated it at the time. We traded all of our depth, all of our flexibility, all of the guys we built our culture with for a single guy who only wanted us only because it seemed like his clearest path to a ring. 

At that point I struggled to even understand what it means to be a fan. I wasn’t watching guys we drafted, discovered, nurtured. Instead it was a bunch of guys who just showed up In Brooklyn overnight—who seemed like they would have been just as happy in any other jersey. So what was I rooting for? Joe Tsai and Sean Marks? The city of Brooklyn? It didn’t even feel like a team to me. So because we went all-in, I went all-in: I started feeling like the only way to justify our moves was winning it all. Championship or bust. I went from being a loyal Nets fan to feeling like anything less than a championship was a waste of my time.

And now here we are: As far away from contention as we were when Marks first took over. A roster built around defense that plays putrid defense. A coach on a long-term deal who seems lost. A (not so) “young core” that looks completely overwhelmed and outmatched night after night, no matter who’s on the other end of the floor. In any other scenario I’d take solace in Bridges’ leadership or Watford’s spark plug play. But instead I’m just bitter and tired. And the path we’re on now feels like ripping a band-aid off one hair at a time.

Respect to anyone who disagrees, but this is the lowest I’ve felt as a fan. They sold us on championship aspirations, blew it in record time, and now treat “success” this season as finishing with a better record than the Pistons, Spurs, and Wizards. If a band I love releases a bunch of bad albums in a row, I stop seeing them live. It doesn’t mean I’m not a fan. It just means I need a break. And right now, with this team, I’m in desperate need of a break. 

I feel sorry for the guys suffering through this situation right now. I imagine they’d rather be anywhere else."
36,Jacque Vaughn issued a statement to ESPN following his dismissal,
37,How would you grade Joe Tsai as an owner since he's taken over in 2019?,"Joe Tsai had a 50% share in the nets and eventually buying the rest of the team in 2019. We've had a lot of arguments on this sub about sean marks, but Tsai hasn't been as discussed. What grade would you give him overall and what are your thoughts on his interactions with the team this season?"
38,"[Begley] Nets surely didn’t want to trade Mikal Bridges to NYK but Bridges’ side was prepared to force the issue by telling teams he wanted to be w/NYK, per SNY sources. Bridges’ side made it clear to BKN that he wanted to be w/NYK, reunite w/Villanova teammates Brunson, Hart, DiVincenzo",
39,Bright future,"Pause on the all star trade talks. Cam Thomas, claxton (still under 25), clowney, Dariq whitehead, watford, sharpe. Tons of future picks and probably a new guy coming in if we trade into the draft. I’m excited and I think the future is bright for us. Don’t get down bc your a hole Knicks fan uncle is trashing the nets we’ll be back. Sean marks built this team with way less last time and this time we’re going to be in an even better spot. We gotta a bright future folks uh"
40,"The Knicks have searched for ways to add extra salary to complete the Mikal Bridges trade and previously discussed potentially adding Miles McBride to the deal, per

The trade hasn't been finalized and I wonder if he was supposed to be apart of the initial framework. It was announced today he had a procedure done on his toe, maybe Sean Marks didn't want to deal with another injured player?

[https://x.com/NY\_KnicksPR/status/1806312908638363669](https://x.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/1806312908638363669)"
41,Cam Thomas on if he had doubts about whether he'd ever be a core piece for the Nets after his first two seasons :,"""No, not really... I always believe in myself... Sometimes it's just timing... I love it here. I got drafted here, so I'll always have a place for it."""
42,"The Nets should be involved in the Donovan Mitchell trade, but not acquire him. ","The Nets went 32-50 and are an old roster. I really don’t understand why they want to trade for a star. There are no legit 2025 free agents that will make it free agency anyways. I believe if they trade for Mitchell they will be a 7 seed that is completely tapped out assets. The suns picks are a goldmine, and I don’t believe it is realistic to be able to acquire a player like Mitchell without giving them up. We should be doing everything in our power to keep those. Brian Windhorst today when listing Donovan Mitchell teams said the Houston Rockets. The Rockets were already a good team this year and they are so young, I believe they are ready to make a big step forward. All of the reporting has been they want to trade for a star this summer.  I think the following 3 team trade makes a ton of sense

**Nets receive:**

3rd overall pick, and all of their future picks back. 

Jalen Green

Dean Wade

Salary filler (landale, Jeff Green)

**Rockets receive:**

Donovan Mitchell

**Cavaliers receive:**

Mikal Bridges

Cam Johnson

Jabari Smith Jr. 

The Cavaliers do not control their own first round pick until 2030! But they have good young talent in garland and Mobley. They want win now pieces, not draft capital. They would acquire 3 good 2 way wings that can be their long term starters at the 2, 3, and 4, and then they can trade Jarrett Allen for additional depth.

The rockets have Thompson and Sengun as foundational front court pieces and FVV as the PG. They desperately need a rim pressure guard who is also a plus shooter. Mitchell is exactly what they need, because he’s essentially what you wanted Jalen Green to be before the draft. FVV-Mitchell-Eason-Amen Thompson-Sengun is an excellent 5 man unit with a lot of room to grow. 

The Nets meanwhile get to rebuild like a normal franchise. Regardless of what you feel about Cam Thomas and Jalen Green (I am personally not a fan of either) they are certainly talented and would be an entertaining backcourt in a tank next season. You start Noah Clowney from day 1, maybe whitehead is a rotation player. Nets can resign Claxton and then flip him and DFS for additional future assets. Then if you nail your rebuild over the next couple years, Sean Marks best skill by far is evaluating talent in the draft, you can be a great team getting lottery picks every year via PHX, which is the formula for sustained excellence. "
43,Are the Brooklyn Nets signing Killian Hayes in an attempt to win the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes?,This is the most creative method of tanking i’ve seen in my life. Everyone thought Killian Hayes was out of the NBA after last season. The nets front office must’ve taken inspiration from the disaster draft post and decided this was the next best option. 
44,Regarding fans at the Barclays…,"Like others, I was definitely bummed out listening to that podcast Mikal was on.

I know it’s been sounding and feeling bad being at the games hearing fans from other teams drown us out. But even before KD and Kyrie there was a really good atmosphere that proves a good product and a hard working team gives Nets fans the right energy and reasons to show up.

Been a fan since ‘01 as a kid in Jersey, but eventually moved to NYC as many do around here. I first joined the BK Block in 2018-2019, and the first 20 or so games were miserable. We were basically on a 10 game losing streak at one point and we had to shout over fans from every other team every night. Somehow even Jazz fans outnumbered us one night which was insane. But then the magic of that year started brewing after that players-only meeting. All of a sudden D’Lo and Caris started playing at an all-star level. Jarret Allen was becoming a force. Rondae and Theo started busting moves on the bench. Game by game you saw more and more Nets fans come back. The whole team was fun to watch and always hustled and grinded, even though many nights we were outmatched on talent.

I vividly remember a game against the  Blake Griffin-led Pistons, and if we won it we clinched a playoff seed. I’ve never heard the place so loud that entire season. The whole arena was on their feet for the last possession of the first half because we were absolutely killing them. 

All the way until the playoffs, we had that same energy in the arena. It was amazing. Even that home game 3 vs Philly in the first round was insane. 

The Knicks have definitely gone through periods where it was just as  miserable to go to games as a fan, although a lot less painful than us in BK considering how many fans they have/how long the team has been there. Their fans can deny that all they want, but my dad is a Knick fan and we would go to games when they sucked, and there were several times fans of other teams drowned out the  Knick fans. Now, they (NYK) have a lot of parallels to the 18-19 Nets, just a better version. 

Sadly, I can’t go to as many games since I’ve moved a bit further away :( But we’ll get back there soon. Just need guys who will go out there and give it their all, and a coach that continually inspires and demands that out of them. 

Oh, and winning a bit helps too."
45,STH Question,"Has anyone with season tickets been asked to move their seats cause of renovation? Apparently my section and a few others they're replacing the chairs and I was contacted last week saying offering to move my seats like 6 rows back (cheaper price). 

I'm trying to be patient here. Every STH rep I've had for the last 2.5 years has been like 22 years old, reading a scripted answer for everything. Trying to sell me memberships to The Row and Key which are insanely expensive but can't exactly answer a basketball question. But I love my team, I love Sean Marks and I absolutely LOVE where my seats are. 

So I told my rep no, she can find me something with the equivalent row IF I have to move seats but it still makes no sense to me. If you're removing a seat per row just move my seat over! There's no way every seat in my row is STH in 2s and 4s. 

This team has taken enough from me. I'm already now forced to pay mikal bridges prices for a rebuild and while I FULLY expect this rebuild to be no more than 1.5 seasons it's still annoying. Yes they made some post kyrie and KD concessions but you can already tell the rebuild offers for new STH members are better than what us existing ones have. I get it it's a business. I'm one of the more forgiving Nets fans and I love Joe Tsai but getting that phone call last week really annoyed me. "
46,26-31 = JV's coaching record since the KD/Kyrie trade,"Correct me if I'm wrong but since the Nets traded Ky/KD the team record under head coach Jacque Vaughn is 26-31. 

Last season we fell backwards into the play-offs as we had the 18-2 cushion from when the stars were here and so many teams were tanking last season that the Nets won games they probably wouldn't normally win if many of the tanking teams weren't attempting to increase their odds of drafting the alien Victor Wembanyama.

So we're under .500 and our roster doesn't fit particularly well together. We have too much depth and when fully healthy we have too many players needing minutes.

This drop defence doesn't seem to take advantage of the skills of our best defensive players. I'd prefer us to go back to switch everything even if it meant getting badly beaten on the boards again.

We seem to be playing CJ as a PF but CJ and Claxton together are a frail front-court. 

CJ is essentially a very tall SG. Claxton has always struggled with the more muscular and heavier big-men. Every player who isn't that same body type struggles with them.

I'm not suggesting we blow up the team because there is no point in tanking when we don't control our pick. However, we need to choose a direction and in my opinion it should be youth. So finding a trade partner(s) for Royce, Dinwiddie and DFS should be a priority. I want Sean Marks to be speaking to other franchises about their interest in our veteran players. What can he get for them.

BenTen is not worth discussing until he gets back on court and who knows whether that will be this season. I don't think we should attach any picks to moving Simmons unless we are using his salary to balance a trade for a high-earning star. 

There will be no coaching change in the short-term but I don't see JV being the long-term solution in Brooklyn.

Develop our young players. Put them in positions to succeed. Trade for more talent. The Philly 2027 pick and the Dallas 2029 pick should be on the table in trade discussions. You do have to give up a good asset in order to bring in a top player."
47,What makes us so different than other teams?,"The nets are coming off their 2nd failed attempt at a championship core in the last 10 yrs both built thru similar methods of attracting disgruntled stars to brooklyn in hopes and both ending with a bad taste in the mouth and without our future draft capital. But right now we actually have a golden opportunity. Yesterday it was reported that the houston rockets would offer several of the nets draft picks (im assuming 2-3) for mikal bridges in a trade package. Idk what the front office is going to do them saying bridges is untouchable doesnt mean much to me bc it could be a negotiating tactic like theyve done in the past with kyrie and KD. That being said the backlash from nets fans is just bewildering to me. Look thru the annals of nba history and look at the nets history in the past 25 yrs. Look at the teams who've won the spurs, the warriors, the lakers, the heat. In all of those championship teams the core has always been a guy they drafted whether it be a tim duncan, kobe bryant or dwayne wade. I dont understand how these historic organizations can choose to rebuild like he spurs recently did for wemby, or like how the heat did before they got dwade, or like how the lakers did in 2010s before using that package to get anthony davis and the nets organization without any pedigree cannot according to certain groups of fans. We've tried the disgruntled star method it's difficult to win that way, you have small title windows and you're at the whims of stars who dont care about your franchise. KD never cared about the nets the way that Jokic cares about the nuggets the same goes for deron williams when we had him. I pray for once we can do things the right way. Most nba championship teams are built thru the draft. We have a golden opportunity presented to get our future back and rebuild. Yes there's other ways you can win but this is the more proven path. We already know sean marks can draft too so that's not something im worried about let him build a team the way sam presti got to build his team or how the nuggets got to build their team. "
48,2024 draft - if we regain our pick which player do we target?,"There is speculation that the Nets are either gonna try and get their picks back from Houston or acquire a pick from another team.

While it could be said the Nets need everything the team has some needs more pressing than others. Does Sean Marks take the best player available or to fill a need?

Have any of you got any opinions on the 2024 draft. It seems it’s the weakest since the 2013 draft and apart from Alex Sarr who does seem the consensus number one and a likely good fit for Atlanta who would you draft if you are GM or making the decision?

My thoughts: Perhaps try and trade down with the Blazers and get 7&14 if we have number 3 overall.

I like what I’ve seen from Tidjane Salaun. I also believe Ron Holland could be one of the best players to come out of this draft.

Since we know have Jordi as head coach I’d see what he thinks of the Spanish prospects and whether Juan Núñez (PG) and Izan Almansa (PF) would be worth stashing on Long Island and developing them as rotation players.

Or should the Nets try and flip the number 3 overall pick? There should always be a team interested in drafting in the top 3 of any draft."
49,Which Brooklyn Net has the most pressure next season?,"1. Cam Thomas will be going into next season as the number 1 option. Will he embrace this role and flourish or will he hit a wall in his development. Cam is one of those Nets players that Nets fans either love or hate. 
2. Ben Simmons is coming into next season for his final year of his contract. His time in Brooklyn has been underwhelming to say the least. Will he turn it around to prove he is worthy of receiving max money in the NBA.
3. So far Cam Johnson has NOT proven he is worth the money the Brooklyn Nets have given him. Can he turn that narrative around next season? 
4. Nic Claxton just got paid a big contract from Brooklyn. Does Nic have to take a jump in his play on the court to prove the Nets made the right decision.

50,The contrarian nature of Jacque Vaughn is losing Brooklyn Nets a lot of games.,"**There is no denying the Nets are struggling. We might not have premier talent on the roster but we have depth and quality NBA rotation players yet many if not all of them are playing very poorly at the moment. It’s bizarre in the extreme that so many of the players are performing poorly at the same time.** 

**Perhaps mood is low within the team as constant losing saps the fun out of competing. But these are proud professionals and this roster doesn’t have divas as in the past.** 

**Many people want a change in head coach - me included - as they hold Jacque Vaughn responsible for the losses and many in-game head scratching decisions which have seen momentum shift to the opposition. Winnable games have been lost this season because of coaching decisions. Substitutions have left us puzzled, the grit and tenacity we used to see in the players has disappeared.** 

**Five man rotations we know don’t pass the eye test and are shown by data to be ineffective are continued with by the head coach.** 

**It really seems to me that Jacque Vaughn is a contrarian and goes against what is popular and obvious. Is it an arrogance or is it further proof that JV isn’t suited to a head coaching position. A coach can have a great career as an excellent assistant and advisor to the head coach. That premier role doesn’t suit everybody.**

**It seems obvious to most of us fans that we have defensive personnel that would excel in switching everything. At training camp Jacque Vaughn implements a heavy drop coverage system on defence. Many fans thought this was unusual at the time but we trust our head coach to find the style of play that makes the team the most competitive it can be.** 

**The drop defence has been a disaster for this team. Is Jacque Vaughn too proud to admit he got it terribly wrong from the start of the season and won’t go back to a style where the players are more effective? The Nets are a much better rebounding team but one would expect that being closer to the rim.** 

**The Nets players sag off who they’re defending to such an extent that players and teams not associated with success in the NBA are having career nights against us shooting from 3pt land. This is happening over and over again this season and will continue given how important the 3 point shot has become in the NBA.** 

**This has been an issue all season. Allowing a bad team like the Charlotte Hornets to come into Brooklyn and shoot a scorching 58.3% from 3 is terrible. When you don’t challenge a team and allow them space you give them confidence. The Hornets beat us in our own building on a night they shot 50.5%/58.3%/100% - looking at that efficiency alone you’d think the Hornets could be a NBA Finals team but no they’re bottom four in the league. Another user** [**u/JurgenFlippers**](https://www.reddit.com/user/JurgenFlippers/) **has a post today which points out the team’s struggles in recent games against opposition 3 point %. Go check it out:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18y37n9/the\_booklyn\_nets\_and\_opponent\_3s/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18y37n9/the_booklyn_nets_and_opponent_3s/)

**Nic Claxton has not continued to improve after a really impressive season last year and this is a contract year for him. The time when pro athletes tend to play hardest to get the highest possible salary for the next few year years. Claxton is not being put in a position to succeed. He’s an incredible perimeter defender who can block shots, he’s not an outstanding natural rebounder.** 

**Claxton is only one example but the same could be said for Mikal Bridges, Cam J, DFS, Royce who could all excel on switching.** 

**As a fan base we were excited by this group of players and while we were under no illusion of a deep-play-off run we knew those players would play hard and compete because they’re very good defenders. At the moment there is complete disinterest among the players and Mikal who is meant to be the leader of this group and was the runner up of a previous DPOY award rarely even looks like a mediocre defender.** 

**Now Mikal may have just hit the wall given the games played and minutes played over the previous half decade plus the long summer stint with team USA but it seems something more.** 

**Mikal was vocally upset about not being able to play more against the Bucks. That was a coaching decision. For such an on-brand player to publicly show disgruntlement at a coaching decision tells us all is not well within the locker room.** 

**Cam Thomas is a divisive figure among the fan base, he’ll be a great player soon and is already an elite scorer but the frequent changing of role for him must mess with his game. It would mess with any player’s game. I fully support the need for Cam to be a better all round player but Cam is not a PG, he’s a scorer who needs to be able to create for others. To ask him to be the lead ball-handler is to give him a responsibility he’s not trained for while also asking him to still shoulder the responsibility to be the team’s most reliable scorer.**  

**In the corporate world you don’t ask a lawyer to become head of marketing. They’re different skills from what the employee trained/studied for.**

**Several times this season when Cam has been scoring efficiently and racking up points I’ve seen Jacque Vaughn sit Cam down and not just for a few minutes to catch his breath. Any hot-hand Cam had is totally cooled down by JV as he sits Cam for an extended amount of time. One poster wrote in a recent game Cam sat for 40 real-time minutes between checking out of the game before being subbed back in. He was hot when he went to the bench. How can a player expect to be able to continue scoring efficiently when he’s lost all momentum. It’s like JV just hits Cam’s breaks. Contrarian behaviour by JV.**

**Last year Jacque Vaughn basically benched Cam for the rest of the season after the trade deadline and straight after Cam’s three successive 40+ games. There were a few minutes here and there but nothing extended and numerous DNP-CDs. Why? We don’t know but it was probably because JV wanted Cam to commit to passing more and playing better defence.** 

**When Cam did get extended minutes again in the regular season finale against Philly Cam poured in 46 points (on 55/75/100) which made people ask why he hadn’t been playing.** 

**I wrote about this here - Fixing the narrative: Cam Thomas elite efficiency in his 40+ point games.**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/178m7uv/fixing\_the\_narrative\_cam\_thomas\_elite\_efficiency/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/178m7uv/fixing_the_narrative_cam_thomas_elite_efficiency/)

**The Nets really struggled to score in the play-offs but Cam T got very few minutes and DNP-CDs. It is this contrarian stubbornness by our head coach which really seems to be holding the team back.** 

**Also I’d like to make the point that the Nets were not a good team last season after the trade deadline. Brooklyn fell backwards into the play-offs because every team around us was tanking for a better chance of winning the Wemby lottery and Kyrie and KD had built a cushion of wins for the team to get to the post-season. The Nets were easily the worst of the 16 teams who competed in the play-offs last season. They couldn’t even steal a game when the 76ers rested Embiid.** 

**This roster has now been together for 11 months. That is more than enough time to realise changes are necessary find a lead ball handler, find a power forward who can rebound next to Nic Claxton. Playing a tall guard like Cam Johnson at PF is not gonna cut it because it gives you the most frail front court in the league.**

**Jacque Vaughn seems like a decent guy but it does appear he’s losing the locker room. Will Sean Marks be brave and relieve JV of his duties if the losing continues?** 

**The Nets should be better than we are from a W-L perspective. I agree the roster has ill-fitting parts with players duplicating each other’s skills while players with other necessary skills are not on our roster. It does suck that Ben Simmons isn’t healthy but it was always naive to think Ben could be relied upon given the past few years of Ben’s career. And while BenTen is a difference maker, a triple single isn’t getting it done.** 

**There’s little point in rehashing well known arguments such as Dinwiddie being a JV favourite and never has his minutes adjusted despite performing poorly while younger players are put on a much shorter leash.** 

**It’s time to make some moves to improve the Nets and improve the mood in the locker room. This is a team still capable of making the post-season while giving its young players some on-court minutes.**

**This roster needs to be shaken up with some trades. Embrace the youth. Allow the players to play to their strengths!** 

**I can’t see Sean Marks firing JV this season especially after the bizarre extension he was awarded less than a year ago.** 

**Let’s make it known loudly that JV is the one who is holding this team back and it comes down to his decisions about how the players are being utilised on court. The question needs to be asked why are so many of our players performing poorly all at the same time?**"

54,Trade chatter: What would a Donovan Mitchell trade with the Cavs actually look like?,"Plenty of speculative reports about Donovan Mitchell potentially being traded to the Nets.

It is speculation and I don't think Sean Marks would make this trade....but let's say he engages in discussions with the Cavs. What would Cleveland want from the Nets in terms of assets and what would Brooklyn refuse to give up? Here are my thoughts.

Not to be included: Cam Thomas, Dariq Whitehead, Noah Clowney. Unprotected picks from Suns.

On the bubble - would need hard negotiating - The unprotected pick from the Mavs in 2029 (could be really valuable). Nic Claxton (he's gonna get paid this summer - my preference is to keep Clax), Mikal Bridges and Day'Ron Sharpe.

Assets available to be traded: Philly's 2027 first round pick (top 8 protected). Dinwiddie, Royce, DFS, Cam J, DSjr, Lonnie, Ben Simmons (would match salaries nicely)!

From the way I see our assets I wouldn't give up enough of what Cleveland would want to get Spyder and I'm okay with this because I don't particularly want to trade for him even though he's a very good player. I think if the Nets are gonna spend some of their future draft equity you don't target a small guard.

My best offer would be

Nets trade: Philly's 2027 first round pick (top 8 protected), unprotected pick from the Mavs in 2029, Dinwiddie, DFS and Royce = outgoing salary of $43,789,151.

Cavs trade: Donovan Mitchell and Isaac Okoro = outgoing salary of $42,082,825.

The trade works if you recreate it here: [https://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ym7xxf5g](https://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ym7xxf5g)

I'd imagine the Cavs turn that down immediately saying it's not nearly enough for a star player. However, they do get three veterans who can help them immediately for a play-off run. Or they could flip Royce, DFS, Dinwiddie for picks and essentially get a haul of picks for Mitchell.

The two picks (Philly/Dallas) could turn out to be high lottery selections for them. 

I would love to find a way to get Ricky Rubio instead as the Nets really do need a ball handler and while Ricky's no longer a starter he would be perfect for Brooklyn setting up other players and finding the open man.

Rubio has the unteachable vision which makes him a magician on the court with him being able to throw highlight passes and bring some razzmatazz to Brooklyn and hype the crowd.

I wouldn't be surprised if Mitchell extends with Cleveland who could pay him around $250 million on a long term deal and then soon after he asks to be traded. Players should always take the money when it's being offered if its this level of dollars.

Cleveland are in a strange position because they're currently 9th in the standings and they need to build around Garland and Mobley.  They won't control their draft for five years as they owe the Jazz 

* 2025 first-round pick
* 2026 pick swap
* 2027 first-round pick
* 2028 pick swap
* 2029 first-round pick

from their trade with Utah for Mitchell.

So Cleveland need to replenish their draft picks a bit (they only lost three picks not five as two are swaps). Yet they still need quality players to compliment their two youngest stars. 

The 2020 NBA draft was a killer for many teams and taking Isaac Okoro with the fifth pick is probably the move which stops Cleveland from becoming a truly dominant team. Just an unfortunate year to have the fifth pick and draft a player that has had limited impact. Not nearly as bad as the Warriors selecting Wiseman which they showed the NBA they are the opposite of his name.

If Cleveland decide to trade Mitchell this season and not prioritise a play-off run this is the last year until 2030 they control their own draft pick so falling down the standings into the draft lottery might allow them to select another blue-chip player to pair with Mobley and Garland. They won't be able to do that again in a future season."
55,Where are all the videos?,For months I’ve seen endless videos about how horrific the nets organization is and how bad of a GM Sean marks is. And honestly I was one of those critics and I wanted the nets to move on from marks bc I felt he was being delusional with bridges. That being said where are all of these content creators now? Where are all of these sports analysts now? The nets pulled off a massive trade getting the bulk of their picks back and getting extreme value for mikal bridges. Where are all the ppl who were angry that the nets didn’t trade mikal for the rockets 2024 pick and Jalen green? It’s just hilarious the level of disrespect this organization gets on a national and local level. But hey we’ll get the last laugh. This week is going to be one of the more historic in franchise history and we’ll get our due back in the coming years 
56,"Erik Slater Interview Cam Thomas about the Nets’ new direction, expectations for his role next season, his contract situation, and more","https://preview.redd.it/hed73my8gycd1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1cc01ded389d922d04d3a7b9097451b8264bfd8

**CP: The Mikal Bridges trade sent the Nets in a new direction. What are your expectations for your role this season? Do you think it changes?**

**Thomas:** “I wouldn’t say it changes, but \[there will\] probably be more of an emphasis on what I’m supposed to do, you know, scoring the ball and playmaking for the guys. So I wouldn’t necessarily say it changes what I do, because I’ve been doing the same thing since I’ve been here. I’ll probably just take it to a different level, for sure.”





**CP: When did you learn about the trade, and what was your reaction?**

**Thomas:** “I was getting ready to go back to New York. It was late at night, and I was packing to go back up, actually. And then somebody sent it to me and I was like, ‘Is that real?’ I was confused. And then they were like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘Oh, wow.’ Whatever happens, happens. I love Mikal. He's a great guy, great player, but I guess that’s the direction we gotta go in, so we gotta see how it goes.”





**CP: You've seen James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Mikal Bridges traded within less than three seasons. What has it been like adjusting on the fly through all these transactions?**

**Thomas:** “I’m kinda used to it at this point, all this crazy stuff that’s been going on my first three years. It’s been crazy, but it’s just part of the business, like everybody says. You can’t really put your feelings into it or dwell on it. This is where \[general manager\] Sean \[Marks\] thinks we should go, so we gotta follow his lead and try to put the best product on the floor. We’re gonna try to do that.”





**CP: You showed a lot of development during the second half of last year. Do you have any specific goals entering your fourth NBA season?**

**Thomas:** “Just being more of a leader. I’m really honing in on that and starting early with that. I kind of did it towards the second half of last year because it’s something I wanted to try as the year went on. I’m gonna try to start this year off focusing on that because, honestly, I am \[a leader\]. I think I’m the second-longest tenured guy on the team, so I am one of the leaders on the team. So I’m definitely trying to hone in on that.”

  


**CP: Was there a moment when you felt like you shifted from being one of the young guys to being a leader? When did that reality set in?**

**Thomas:** “Probably as soon as the summer started. You look at the roster and you’re like, ‘Dang.' Then obviously when Mikal got traded, that’s when it really clicked in. I’m really one of the longest-tenured guys on the team, so I have a good say on what goes on around here and people listen to what I say. So I definitely wanna be a good resource for the young guys and just help out as much as I can. And obviously, I hope everything leads to wins, but we’ll see.”

  


**CP: You're entering the final year of your rookie contract and are eligible for an extension. Have you discussed an extension with the Nets? What do you think your future holds in Brooklyn?**

**Thomas:** “I haven’t really talked about it much. Like I said before, I'm just trying to get ready for the season. Whatever happens, happens. All that is gonna come. Im not really worried about that. If I get minutes and play, I feel like I’m one of the best players in the league, and I can really showcase myself. But as far as thinking about that right now, nah, I’m not really focused on that. I’m just trying to be the best player I can be and just keep getting better and get ready for my fourth year.”

60,The Day After the Mikal Trade,
61,Targeting one of the San Antonio's 2025 first round picks in exchange for our veteran player(s) ,"The San Antonio Spurs seem to want to step up the timeline on making progress with Wemby. They would be looking for high quality people and good shooting to put around VW. They should be interested in Cam Johnson especially as the 2025 free agency doesn't seem to have any stars that would fit within the Spurs culture.

The Spurs have multiple picks in the 2025 draft. They have their own, they have Atlanta's unprotected pick, they have Chicago's pick but only if it falls 11-30 and they have Charlotte's lottery protected pick which the Hornets will likely keep next year.

We can be certain that the Atlanta unprotected pick will not be made available at all.

Sean Marks should be looking to trade for the Chicago pick which could give us a pick just outside of the top 10. And if the pick doesn't convey the following year it is protected even more lightly 1-8 and the same protections in 2027. If it doesn't convey in 2027 it's a 2028 2nd round pick. 

If Chicago decide to tank would ownership really tank for three more seasons to ensure their first round pick doesn't convey."

When the opportunity presented itself, he called me, and I knew before it came out to the media. I was very excited because I know how the NBA works, and I know how good you can get when you have assets, flexibility, and so forth. I’m just very excited.”

He’s a true pro and he’s a player that is considered one of the best players in this league. That’s why we got what we got for him. So, after that, I don’t like to think back. I like to think in a positive way where he’s going to be on a winning team, so I’m happy for him. We’re going to be building something very special, so I’m very happy for us. Other than that, there’s never a second guess. I’ve never second-guessed anything in my life. I know what’s in front of us, what’s the adversity that we’re going to face, and my job is going to be a problem-solver, make those guys work, make the program build a culture and identity, and that’s how we’re going to go with it.""

&#x200B;

>**What are your expectations for the Nets this season?**   
>  
>**JF:** The expectations are to get better every day, to be connected, and to do what’s best for the team. If we do that every single day, we’re going to be fine. I need everybody in the organization to understand that it’s not something you say one day. You’ve got to put the work into it. I think so far our guys have been amazing. For eight weeks, they’ve been working really hard. They’re going to do a great job here in Vegas. At the end of the day, wins and losses are going to take care of themselves. We’re not extremely worried about that. I’m worried about how hard we play, how we support each other, and how we challenge each other. All those things are going to be important.

&#x200B;

I’m going to do everything I can to support the message and to make sure those guys play hard and get better. So far, they’re doing it. There’s always two steps forward, one back, and three forward. We can’t get comfortable. We have to fight and keep working. During an 82-game regular season there are a lot of good things that can happen. I want this team to do things the right way. So far, based on what these young guys are doing, we’re going to be good.

Me and the organization believe he’s still getting much better and can be a Defensive Player of the Year. He’s a good playmaker and can be an even better playmaker. We’re excited about his development and that he’s a part of the organization for a long time.

I’ve coached my own team with the Canadian national team, and I’ve been a head coach in the G League. I’ve experienced a young team that we were patient with, and we made it all the way to the championship. I experienced an older team in Cleveland that won a championship. I’ve experienced the longest playoff drought in history and fixed it in one year. I’ve had great people that I’ve worked for, and I think I can put together all of the stuff I’ve learned and translate it in Brooklyn.

67,Nets are great at developing bigs,"Just a random thought from watching the game last night: the Nets are great at developing big men.

Three straight big men drafted in the second half of the 1st round. Allen became a borderline AS, got a 100M contract. Claxton is on his way to getting a big contract as well. And now Sharpe (taken right at the end of the first) has become a good big man off the bench and is on track to continue to improve.

68,"Brooklyn Nets soil themselves in Boston, lose 136-86 (Via Lucas Kaplan on Twitter, read more below⬇️)","https://www.netsdaily.com/2024/2/14/24073497/nets-vs-celtics-136-86-jacque-vaughn

All the Nets really had to do this season was be feisty and compete. To represent the “Brooklyn grit” everyone in the organization, all the way up to Sean Marks and Joe Tsai, had vouched for. 

The plan is the plan, and it was set in motion when the Nets didn’t trade Mikal Bridges and Dorian Finney-Smith for a combined six first-rounders at the 2023 NBA Trade deadline.

Alright, fine. Go have a fun year, probably missing out on the playoffs — even on their best days, there is not much offensive talent on the roster — but setting yourself up in the long-term. Create buzz. As cliché as it sounds.

Ending the first half of the season by letting a rival drop a 50-bomb on you (FIFTY!) encapsulates how that effort is going. The starting point guard, who’s known this organization longer than any other Net, pretty openly quit on the team. Brooklyn is now 8-23 since December 13. They are 9-26 against teams above .500.

After 17 minutes of game-time on Wednesday night, the Nets had 17 points. It never got better. When Boston’s deep-bench players like Neemias Queta and Oshae Brissett weren’t throwing down windmills, they were hanging on the rim after dunking with both hands.

There are so many fascinating stories in the NBA this season, from these very Celtics to the drama of the Milwaukee Bucks, to the New York Knicks’ ascendance, to the young Oklahoma City Thunder arriving in full force. 

Maybe you’re curious about the three-star experiments of the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns, or the Denver Nuggets’ quest to repeat, or the Minnesota Timberwolves putting it all together. And LeBron is on the Lakers, by the way.

It would take a hefty, hefty embarrassment for national media — dying to get to the All-Star break as much as the players are — to turn their attention to Eastern Conference’s 11-seed on the last day of the first half of the season. Well, the Nets produced such an embarrassment.

It’s the type of loss where changes soon follow. It’s the type of loss where such media will ask, “What is going on in Brooklyn?”

Nobody has the answers.

As a treat for their dominant start to the season, Boston held a carnival at TD Garden on Valentine’s Day. And the Nets were the traveling circus."
69,I think it's important we manage our expectations the next two days,"If you never lived through a Sean Marks trade deadline, then you should know not to buy into anything you're seeing or hearing about in the media (except for maybe Woj). This FO is known for keeping their cards close to their vest, but also for sending up smoke screens to disguise the real deals they're working on.

Realistically, I would expect next to nothing to happen, BUT, at the same time, Marks knows he needs to make moves and Spence, DFS, and Royce absolutely have value (don't buy into that shit where they don't). All three would help a contending team and we will gladly take back any late FRPs next year and beyond.

One last thing: none of us can predict what Marks does. I think aside from the Harden trade, I can't think of any time where a trade was made at or around the deadline (or any time on the calendar) that we all saw coming. It's more likely some wild shit goes down with a team that we never considered. For example, I wouldn't be shocked if Spence gets traded to someone like Detroit or if Royce gets traded to someone like G-State or if DFS gets traded to, I don't know, Minnesota? I'm not suggesting these will happen, I'm just saying all these ""reports"" with the Lakers and Mavs and whoever are likely untrue. We all should know better by now how this team operates behind the scenes."

73,A Nets player will win the NBA's Most Improved Player award,"I think a Brooklyn player has a very good chance to win a major award this season: the NBA's Most Improved Player. The past winners of the MIP award have made the jump into All-Star territory or beyond to All-NBA or MVP and are all impressive names.

2022–23 - Lauri Markkanen

2021–22 - Ja Morant

2020–21 - Julius Randle

2019–20 - Brandon Ingram

2018–19 - Pascal Siakam

2017–18 - Victor Oladipo

2016–17 - Giannis Antetokounmpo

2015–16- CJ McCollum

2014–15 - Jimmy Butler

2013–14 Goran Dragić

2012–13 Paul George

So the current/pre-season favourite (according to betting odds) is Mikal Bridges. On the Suns he was averaging 17 points per game. His post-trade deadline form with Brooklyn increased to 26 points on similar efficiency. If he can repeat that form while being able to be a lockdown defender again then he has a very good chance to win. It would be awesome if Mikal can continue his form and show he belongs in the upper tier of players in this league.

There could be a case made for Nic Claxton to win MIP although he seems more focused on the Defensive Played of the Year award. At media day Clax spoke with passion about how he feels he was robbed of the award after KD and Kyrie were traded and the media focus left Brooklyn. He has a very good case for being All-Defence last season.

An off-season of working out and adding muscle, improving his shot and maybe this season we see some of those ""Big Guard"" skills which the Claxton family have talked about Nic having since college. We haven't seen them so far in the NBA. 

This is also Claxton's contract year and he'll likely sign a contract for generational money in the off-season. I expect the Nets to extend him but it will be very expensive. If thats the case it means Brooklyn have a top (defensive) player for his prime years. A great selection by Sean Marks in the second round of the draft.

The unlikely candidate but in my opinion still possible to win MIP is Cam Thomas. One reason for this is his stats should improve more than almost anyone else competing for this award. 

Cam Thomas has a career average of 9.5ppg but if he is given/earns consistent minutes it would seem probable he could double those numbers easily and that would make voters of the award take Cam seriously, it is an award for monitoring improvement.

The third season is generally when players tend to take a leap and we saw from media day that Cam has worked on his body over the summer putting on 10 pounds of muscle. This will help him on both ends of the floor.

For all the people that say Cam doesn't pass or defend we've heard that refrain constantly but few players in the league are as gifted scorers as Cam Thomas. His stats are eye-popping. 

I believe in the 15 games where Thomas played 25 or more minutes this past season, he averaged 26.1 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists on 48/50/90 shooting splits. Elite efficiency. According to StatMuse when Cam Thomas starts he averaged 33 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.5 assists. However, he has started only 6 games in his career. Yet it is these numbers which point toward Cam being a very special player.

Mikal will be the first option for Brooklyn but I wouldn't be surprised to see Cam Thomas become the most reliable late clock option when the team needs a bucket as time winds down.

We know Cam can go off for 40+ points like he showed four times last season. And in two of those he played against CJ and Mikal while they were on the Suns just before they got traded and he scored on Kawhi and PG against the Clippers. He wasn't putting up numbers on nobodies. 

I suspect we'll see several more 40 point games from Cam this season, I even believe he'll go for 50 twice this season and if there is any Net that I think could break the franchise record for points in a game currently held by Kyrie then I think Cam could score 61 and break the record."

75,"Mike Scotto talks about Potential Trade Candidates (Spencer Dinwiddie, Royce O'Neale, Dorian Finney-Smith & Nic Claxton)","With teams across the league looking for potential wing and point guard help, the Brooklyn Nets have several trade candidates, depending on the direction the team goes ahead of February’s trade deadline.

**Spencer Dinwiddie**, who became the third Net in franchise NBA history with 1,500 or more assists and 500 or more threes, joining **Jason Kidd** and **Vince Carter**, is among the names to keep an eye on in the coming months.

“Dinwiddie can help a team and make big shots,” an NBA executive told HoopsHype.

An upcoming unrestricted free agent, Dinwiddie has continuously referenced **Mikal Bridges**, **Cam Johnson**, **Nic Claxton**, and **Ben Simmons** as core members of Brooklyn’s future while complimenting **Cam Thomas** and **Lonnie Walker** when [**talking about the team’s future**](https://twitter.com/erikslater_/status/1724636919823311152).

“That all comes down to **Joe Tsai** and **Sean Marks** at the end of the day,” Dinwiddie [**told The HoopsHype Podcast**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nets-spencer-dinwiddie-ben-simmons-cam-thomas-cam-johnson-kevin-durant-james-harden-free-agency/) just before the regular season when asked about his future. “I’ll be a free agent at the end of the year. I earned my pension already, so it is what it is. We’ll see what happens after that. If the team wins and we’ve got guys rolling, at the bare minimum, I’ve left the team in good hands, and if it’s time for me to ride off into the sunset, that’s what it is, and I’ll be a Brooklyn Nets fan.”

NBA executives across the league are also monitoring Brooklyn’s wings, including **Dorian Finney-Smith** and **Royce O’Neale**.

Finney-Smith has previously drawn interest from several playoff-caliber teams, including the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Heat, Philadelphia 76ers, and Memphis Grizzlies (before several injuries changed their trajectory this season), among other teams, league sources told HoopsHype.

Given that Finney-Smith is signed through the 2024-25 season before a $15.38 million [**player option**](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/brooklyn_nets/) decision for the 2025-26 season, rival executives expect the Nets to continue to have a high asking price worth the equivalent of two first-round picks if they trade him with the hope that the asking price will drop closer to the trade deadline.

A few executives who spoke with HoopsHype believe Brooklyn would want a protected first-round pick for O’Neale, an upcoming unrestricted free agent.

Rival executives are also monitoring Nets center **Nicolas Claxton** and have asked one consistent question regarding the 24-year-old center who will become an unrestricted free agent this summer: Will Brooklyn pay up to keep him?

Given recent average annual salaries for centers **Jarrett Allen** ($20 million), **Jusuf Nurkic** ($17.5 million), **Deandre Ayton** ($33.2 million), **Jakob Poeltl** ($19.5 million), and **Brook Lopez** ($24 million) in free agency the past few offseasons, Claxton is projected to be over earn over $20 million per year in free agency.

Currently, Claxton is viewed as a core member of the Nets moving forward, barring a trade offer that blows the team away.

Looking further ahead, **Ben** **Simmons** will be in the final year of his contract during the 2024-25 season at $40.34 million, making him a potential trade chip in the summer of 2024 due to his expiring contract – whether he can stay healthy or not this season."
