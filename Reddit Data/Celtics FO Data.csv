0,Celtics looking to bring the All-Star Game back to Boston in 2029,"> The **Boston Celtics** are interested in hosting All-Star weekend in 2029. According to team president Rich Gotham who was speaking with **Gary Washburn of the Boston Globe,** the franchise has held preliminary discussions with the league office. The city of Boston hasn’t hosted an All-Star weekend since 1964, despite the inaugural festivities being held in the city back in 1951.  
>  
>Should Boston be approved as the 2029 All-Star weekend host, it will be the first time in 67 years. For most Celtics fans, it will be the first time the city has held the festivities within their lifetime.  
>  
>“We’ve had those conversations with both the NBA and the city of Boston and a lot of different constituencies, including TD Garden and Meet Boston,” Gotham told The Globe. “We’ve had some preliminary conversations, and there’s enthusiasm from all the parties to bring the game to Boston. We’re working at it.”  
>  
>Over the years, the All-Star game has grown in both stature and popularity. It garners global attention. It generates a surge in tourism. Most importantly, though, it brings a wealth of business and economic opportunities to the city, not just for the weekend but in the years building up to the event. Of course, such a big city-wide spectacle requires a high level of infrastructure within the city.  
>  
>Gotham feels confident that the recent redevelopments in Boston have given the Celtics a strong chance of succeeding with their bid.  
>  
>“The economic impact is really big,” Gotham told Washburn. “It’s not quite the **Super Bowl** but as far as sporting events go, it’s a big event. It’s the NBA version of the Super Bowl and it draws people from all over the world. The media coverage is global and it would be a great way to showcase Boston and Boston is certainly, particularly with all the development that’s gone on in the Seaport, all the hotels, the facilities, Boston’s definitely a viable destination, so we’re hoping to be able to bring a game (here). I think 2029 is likely but nothing is locked in at this point.”

I'd rather be in the mix and have my guts ripped out, than suck. And those two have been really good for a long time.""",
3,[John Fanta] The Boston Celtics get an absolute gem of a selection in Baylor Scheierman. The guy is so incredibly skilled offensively. Has the makeup of someone who will play 10+ years in the league. Elite feel and IQ. Unlimited range. Terrific add for Brad Stevens and Boston.,

8,This will be Brad Stevens first year selecting in the fist round,"We own the 30th and 55th pick this year. It is most likely that neither of these players play any meaningful minutes this year. That would be fine. Let's be reasonable.

This is also the first year Brad Stevens will draft in the first round so how many all stars do you think this pick will get selected for? Do you think we could trade the pick for the next Derrick White again? Surely attaching my mental health to the success of the last pick is healthy and warranted"
9,"[Turpin] Wyc Grousbeck on WEEI ""I sat there the whole second half of (Game 7) and started thinking about (making changes). Then I took 2 days to think about it and went and met with Brad Stevens and Joe Mazzulla and said we are not bringing back the same team.""","""It's been two seasons in a row of really good play but inconsistencies they showed in the Finals two years ago and then the Conference Finals last season. It just felt inconsistent, I wanted to change the mix.""

""The reports out of camp and the practices I've seen, there is a real connection between the guys, there is a real energy, and there is a commitment. The word they are using is 'Mindfulness' and also 'Sacrifice'

""Brad and Joe said that they wanted to bring in Jeff as a consultant and asked what I thought of it... That's their decision, not my decision. If those two want to bring in Jeff Van Gundy, it's fine by me.""

""I'm not there coaching or trying to be a coach. I'm there to be supportive and just show authentic win the banner or die trying mentality from the ownership side.""

""I look back at last year not as a failure of coaching or a failure of anything else, I think we just got inconsistent at the end. I think there has been buy-in. Part of mixing it up which we did deliberately over the summer.""

""There is just a freshness and electricity around the practice facility that does feel a little bit different.""

""I know this is a lot of happy talk this morning, but this is authentic. This is how I really feel. This isn't a commercial, this is what's really happening in my mind and what I see.""

""It's not the 'or bust part' because I don't think it's a one and done or it's a now or never... I think we might have a 6-year run here... Jayson and Jaylen are in their mid-20s."""

16,"10 years ago, we were in the beginning (and somehow close to the end) of our rebuild. How did you feel about Brad Stevens and the teams direction at the time? ","First year head coach. No more Pierce and KG. A new era for the Boston Celtics. A rebuild was among the team, a high draft pick in the upcoming draft, how long did you think it would take to be a contender again?

10 years later this year ended up being the ONLY year the Celtics wouldn’t make the playoffs in the 2008-2024 stretch. The Isaiah Thomas trade accelerated the rebuild like no other. He kept the team a playoff contender up until those Nets draft picks finally cashed in.

Now we’re looking at what’s arguably the most talented roster we’ve ever had. With Brad off the sideline and in the basketball operations chair. Even though a title would secure this, it’s still been one of the most successful rebuilds of all time. "
17,Statement from Brad Stevens: “…we are onto Game 5!”,"“I am so thankful to work for the Celtics. Our ownership group has given us the support and resources to build this team. The players, coaches, front office, and support staff are amazing — superstars in their jobs across the board. This recognition has everything to do with the team, and nothing to do with any one individual. Great teams require that everyone in the building is fully committed to each other and moving in one direction. With that in mind, we are onto Game 5!”"
18,Opinions on Brad Stevens?,"I’m from Indiana, and love Brad for his time as our coach at Butler. I rooted for him as a head coach with you guys as well, and always considered him to be a basketball genius.

35,"[Robb] Jrue Holiday on Brad Stevens: ""He's a kind soul.""",
36,Brad Stevens is a very good GM. But his weakpoint is the draft?," Since becoming the GM of the team. His main source of luck when it comes to the draft has been a few undrafted 3 pt shooting talents in Hauser and Peterson.  Hauser is a proven NBA player now. Peterson has the making of Hauser 2.0.  He played well in the G league last season. Has looked very sharp in the 2 SL games he has played. Especially on defense, crashing all over the place and even blocking shots. Helps tha he is 6'8 or 6'9. 

Outside of these pickups, the actual draft picks haven't panned out.  Looks like the team is done/separate ways with Madar and Begharin.  

Jordan Walsh looks like has either hit the Sophomore jinx or  is not a legit NBA talent.  His overall D is decent. But in terms of offense. Nothing stands out. Perhaps a lack of progression.

JD Davison looks like has the Killian Hayes syndrome. Just too quiet and unnoticeable at times on the court.  When he is into it, his shot has been inconsistent. He tries to rely too much on the dribble, drive and kickout... but its clean only half the time. Not a pure SG or PG.

Baylor Scheierman and Anton Watson are too soon to say. But some are not happy that Filipowski, Furphy, Klintman were passed over Scheireman.  These three players have been cooking in SL in regards to offensive output. Scheireman has struggled ...surprisingly with his bread and butter 3 pt shot.  

Anton Watson on the other hand has been a pleasent surprise. He lead the team in points, 3 pts attempted (finally) and plus/minus yesterday.  Like Al Horford, such a calm presence out on the floor. Never seems sped up. Methodical player that looks like is floating out there but suddenly utilizes bursts to get his spot 1st.  Get to missed jump shots etc.

41,Brad Stevens tells the Globe Malcolm Brogdon is healthy and ready to go for #Celtics training camp. Kristaps Porzingis is also a go.,"Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens told the Globe on Tuesday that his team is completely healthy going into training camp, and that includes Malcolm Brogdon and Kristaps Porzingis.

Stevens, who arrived in Boston following a speaking engagement to make his annual appearance at the ABCD Hoops Dreams tournament at TD Garden, acknowledged that Brogdon was upset about nearly being traded to the Clippers in July, but the sides have had conversations over the past few weeks.

Brogdon has arrived in Boston and will be ready for training camp.

“Everybody’s in Boston, everybody’s healthy, knock on wood,” Stevens said. “If everybody gets through the rest of the week, we should be full next Tuesday when we start practice. We’re excited about that.”"
42,Brad Stevens has had arguably the best 3 years of trades of any executive in NBA history (and ranking them is extremely difficult),"How would you guys rank the trades from the Brad era? I found it kinda hard to.

**There were the significant ones like:**

Al Horford, Moses Brown and a 2023 second for Kemba Walker, a 2021 first (did become Sengun but not for OKC), 2025 second

Jrue Holiday for Brogdon, Rob, 2029 first and 2024 Warriors first

Derrick White for JRich, Romeo, 2022 first and 2028 pick swap

KP, 2023 Grizz first (flipped for seconds and Walsh) and 2024 Warriors first for Smart, Gallo, Muscala, 2023 2nd

Malcolm Brogdon for Nesmith, Theis, filler (sorry Malik Fitts) and 2022 first

**There were some other trades that weren't as significant but panned out well:**

Xavier Tillman for Lamar Stevens, 2027 and 2030 second rounders

Josh Richardson for Moses Brown

Dennis Schroder, Bruno Fernando and Enes Freedom for Daniel Theis

**There are some that were just salary dumps or didn't move the needle:**

Tristan Thompson for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, 2023 second

Justin Jackson, two future seconds for Mike Muscala

Kris Dunn, Carsen Edwards, 2026 second swap for Juancho Hernangomez

Hernangomez for Bol Bol and PJ Dozier

Bol Bol and Dozier to Orlando

Dalano Banton to Portland

Grant Williams for 2024, 2025 and 2030 seconds

Of this list, how many were that bad? The Brogdon one wasn't great because he got hurt in the playoffs and Nesmith ended up blossoming in Indy, but we turned Brogdon into Jrue. Getting rid of Grant for just picks was not ideal but Grant absolutely sucked in Dallas and it's not like the team really missed him. Maybe giving up on Bol Bol or Kris Dunn too early? Either way they were bad in that they were inconsequential. Stellar job by Bradley!"

 Correct me if I'm Wrong,  but we're Sam Hauser and Justin  Champignie and Justin Jackson the only back up wings last year.

 I consider Grant a big that can hit a three and guard some stronger wings but he's certainly not a typical wing defender.

 Brad has suddenly went Wing shopping Ala Danny Ainge except he got a six piece of assorted flavors on a budget. 

Hauser, Svi, Brissett,  Lamar Stevens,  Blanton,  And Jordan Walsh. Brad just flooded the team with 6'5"" to 6'8"" quick footed wings with a few of them.having seven foot wingspan.

 I'm not saying it's the greatest collection of role players,  but having six options,  and six fouls , and a few shooters to choose from and a few very capable defenders should bode well for Joe and the Celtics. 

 The Jay's should get more rest with these kids and Porzingis and Holiday additions."

I know some of the success is build on a good job by Danny. But i feel Danny also abuses the Genius of Coach Brad. And kept putting him into difficult positions instead of trying to help Brad achieve the goals of winning a chip as a coach. 

Near the end, Danny just wasnt doing a good enough Job for Brad to succeed and yet he was the scapegoat of all things that is going wrong for the team. Thankfully his genius was not overlook by the owners. 

Although i understand that the move to GM partly due to his own accords. I dont doubt that the many unwarranted criticism he recieve was also part of the reason why he choose to step aside. "

My fear is, does he have an itch to get back into coaching.  Tbh, ever since he made the move upstairs, I thought it was basically a stop for him until it was time for Coach K to retire and then Brad would go there.  

But I mean I guess as long as he’s enjoying it as the GM/POBO and we’re paying him well… why would he want to leave?

72,Brad Stevens jokes how Jrue Holiday got so physical with assistant coach Phil Pressey at practice today that it made Pressey question if he should quit coaching.,
73,Brad Stevens has done a great job with filling out the backup wing/forward spots,"So as the title says I think Stevens has done a very nice job building up the backup wing/forward depth with a combination of size, offball movement, and a variety of skill sets for Joe Mazzulla to choose from.

-Sam Hauser and Svi Mykhailiuk are both movement shooters that are better defensively than most think(I'd say Hauser is a bit better as both a shooter and a defender, but Svi adds some secondary playmaking which could be useful for 4 bench player lineups since Brogdon is more SG than PG).

-Oshae Brissett's 3 ball is questionable, but for a team that will(sadly) be playing a lot of games without all 3 of Porzingis, Rob and Horford available he's a useful PF to have as a guy who has the strength to body up opposing bigs similar to what Grant would sometimes do.

-Lamar Stevens and Jordan Walsh are both absolute dawgs on defense with great measurables that'll also bring a ton of grit and hustle for a team that lost a fair bit of it when Smart and Grant weren't brought back. If either of them can shoot it they'll be incredibly useful role players, but even if not the fact they play hard will still endear them to the fans and make them useful backup minute sponges for the regular season at least.

Another thing I love about all 5 of them is that they know how to move off the ball, either through well timed cuts or moving around the 3 point line to make themselves available as an easy kickout target. Even to more casual fans it was pretty obvious that as last season went on the offball movement oriented offense that Mazzulla had initially installed to start the year slowly faded away before essentially being non-existent by the time the playoffs had arrived. It seems pretty clear to me that Brad Stevens wants the team to be able to get back to that style of play as he's added guys not just with size, but also the ability and comfort to move off the ball which should really serve to benefit the offense in year 2 under Mazzulla."
74,Brad Stevens after timeout plays,"He always makes the best after timeout plays, especially for the last shot, from his rookie season, he drew a Jeff Green play to beat the Heat, Al Horford's game winners, Evan Turner, Marcus Morris, hell even Jared Sullinger too! He doesn't just drain the clock and make ISO plays. This is why sometimes I miss Brad as the head coach. Hope Joe and his crew cook some late game situation plays."
75,Brad Stevens addresses Neemias Queta roster spot option for Celtics,
76,"(Shaughnessy) In conversations with some sources close to the situation, I’ve come away convinced that soon-to-be-90-year-old H. Irving Grousbeck is the one driving this sale and that 63-year-old son Wyc...actually owns a relatively small stake in the franchise.","Irving Grousbeck — still teaching at Stanford Business School — has been the money behind the group since the beginning and there’s every indication that the billionaire (Forbes lists “Irving Grousbeck and family’s” worth at $1.8 billion) rarely seen at Celtics games is motivating this sale in an attempt to get his affairs in order.

H. Irving Grousbeck made his fortune as cofounder of Continental Cablevision and is no doubt interested in ongoing negotiations for the NBA’s media rights. A nine-year deal is set to expire at the end of next season and the new deal (reportedly close to $76 billion) will have considerable impact on franchise values.

I emailed the elder Grousbeck late Wednesday, requesting comment on my assertions, and he responded Thursday with a polite no comment.

When I texted Wyc with, “You OK if I say your personal stake in the team is less than 2 percent?”, he answered, “We hold as a family — all unified . . . We are a family and I also have a Celtics family is my comment. Thanks.”

This leads us to Steve Pagliuca, often identified as “co-owner” of the Celtics. Pags made his money at Bain Capital and has been Wyc Grousbeck’s wingman since the group bought the team. Pags is the one who had the idea to hire Danny Ainge, who wound up being the genius to acquire Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo (2008 champs), then Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Brad Stevens, and Joe Mazzulla.

Many fans want Pagliuca to emerge as the next majority owner of the team and Pags made his intentions clear the day the sale was announced, issuing this statement: “Being a co-investor and managing partner of the Celtics has been a great honor and a labor of love. I hope to be part of the Celtics moving forward and will be a proud participant in the bidding process that has been announced today.”

Most of our rivals for the championships have very little flexibilities to improve their roster which is good news for us. Also we still can potentially outbid a lot of teams to improve our roster. Amazing work by Brad Stevens.

Not just NBA fans saying this but NBA Analysts too. Like what, have we been seeing the same basketball?

 The Celtics should undoubtedly be incredibly heavy favourites for these finals, the fact ppl don’t believe the series is more likely to end in 5 games for Boston than any other result has red-pilled me about basketball discourse. 

The way I see it the current Celtics are the best team this decade yet they’ve been talked as underdogs for some weird reason. As if the Celtics “easy path” isn’t directly related to their performance in the regular season. 

I posed this question in an other sub, and all I came way with was responses that Luka cold and Kyrie is a closer as if the former isn’t hobbled and that they’re not playing alltime team."
89,[OC] Jrue Holiday Trade Primer - And Why I Think It's A Near Lock,"2 years ago, I called the Kemba Walker/Al Horford [swap a near lock](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/nqwsxd/oc_the_danger_of_the_luxury_tax_and_why_a/). Today, I will try to channel the same energy into manifesting this Jrue Holiday trade. Let’s get to it

**The deal**

&#x200B;

|Celtics receive|Blazers receive|
|:-|:-|
|Jrue Holiday|Malcolm Brogdon|
||Payton Pritchard|
||Blake Griffin (sign-and-trade)|
||Luke Kornet|
||Sam Hauser|
||2024 Celtics 1st Round Pick|
||2024 Warriors 1st Round Pick|
||Right to swap Celtics pick in 2030|
||$3.5 million in cash considerations|

Celtics outgoing salary -> 22.5 + 4 + 3.8 + 2.4 + 1.9 = 34.6

Maximum incoming salary Celtics can take in as a team above the first apron-> 34.6 \* 1.1 + 0.25 = 38.31

36.8 < 38.31, so I think the trade works financially. Now a breakdown of why it makes sense to trade each asset in each deal

**Malcolm Brogdon**

The Celtics need to send out one big salary to serve as salary matching in this deal. Obviously not trading Tatum, Brown and Porzingis can’t be legally traded because they signed extensions, and White doesn’t make enough to avoid putting another big salary in this deal, so that leaves Brogdon.

I’m personally a big Brogdon fan, but there’s quite a few reasons that trading him would be the right move.

First, there’s been *rumors* that he is unhappy with the Celtics front office, either for the reported trade to the Clippers or how they handled his injury during the playoffs. Whichever it is, this deal provides a straightforward way for the Celtics to clean this messy situation and not have to worry about this affecting team chemistry going into the season.

Second, Brogdon clearly has some long-term injury issues that are worrying. He reportedly has bad knees which are not gonna get better as he ages. We had to restrict him to 26 mpg and sit him on back-to-backs just to try and keep him healthy for the playoffs. He still ended up with an unrelated injury, but it just goes to show that availability seems to always be an issue for him. We already have two injury-prone players in Porzingis and Williams, so this could be a way for the Celtics to reduce their overall injury risk.

The third reason is that Holiday is a clear upgrade on the court over Brogdon, but I will discuss that more in a later section.

**Payton Pritchard**

Including Pritchard in this deal should be an easy decision for the Celtics, given he was reported as a player that Portland was interested in. He had his career-low in total minutes last year as Joe Mazzula last season clearly was not a fan of his, often opting to play Sam Hauser and Luke Kornet over him. He was outwardly unhappy with his role and requested a trade last season. Even though he is in line for a bigger role this season, it seems unlikely that he will stay in Boston beyond this year given he doesn’t fit the defensive scheme well.

I think his role on this team could easily be replaced by a veteran point guard on a minimum contract, a prime candidate being the recently released Cameron Payne.

**Blake Griffin/Luke Kornet**

Griffin would solely be in this trade for salary matching purposes, as would Luke Kornet.

Griffin could sign-and-trade ~~for a three year veteran’s minimum contact~~  as a non-Bird free agent with the last two years unguaranteed. Portland could release him immediately, and Boston could compensate them for this cap hit by sending them cash compensation in the deal. Griffin would presumably agree to the free $3 million.

It’s actually a stroke of luck that Griffin hasn’t signed either with the Celtics or another team yet, as the salary matching gets tougher without this option, with him being the only player from last years roster eligible to be sign-and-traded I believe.

Luke Kornet is a solid 4th string center, but his role should be easily replaceable by a center on a minimum contract.

**Sam Hauser**

I actually think having to include Hauser in this deal would be the one part that the Celtics fanbase would be unhappy about, and rightfully so. Hauser is on a great value contract for the next two seasons, and he was a fun watch last season as a breakout wing shooter. But ultimately the Celtics need to include one more salary in this deal, and Hauser is the last man standing.

The way to justify his inclusion for me is

* He’s at best the 8th player in our rotation right now, and his ceiling is probably… 7th best? Still a useful player to have, but if you’re trying to acquire an All-Star caliber player, you can’t let the 8th man in your rotation be the deal-breaker
* Holiday is such a good fit in our starting/closing lineup that I think the lineup upgrade is well worth the slight bench loss, especially since it will be closing lineup that will be deciding playoff games and probably not the 8th man’s performance
* Hauser would likely face a similar issue to Pritchard in the playoffs as a defensive weakness that other teams could take advantage of, so his role would be limited anyways

~~Also I don’t think Walsh can be included in lieu of him: when I did the math with Walsh in place of Hauser, I got that we would be \~ $18,000 short in outgoing salary? Could be wrong if someone wants to correct that~~ I was wrong, I believe Walsh can included in lieu of Hauser. But I would actually still rather trade Hauser because a) Hauser cheap cap figure ends before the money crunch gets real in 2025-2026 (more on that later) b) Walsh will cheap for longer which could be really valuable and c) I think Walsh has higher upside as a really good defensive wing, something this team is really lacking

**1st round picks**

There’s some nuance with the draft picks we have that leads me to think that this deal will really happen.

First, we have 2 first round picks for 2024 and 1 in each year after that, so we actually have a “surplus” of picks compared to the normal state. Given how contending teams like the Bucks and Suns have basically traded as many draft picks as possible, the Celtics need to move in that direction if they want to maximize their chances of winning a championship this year. They should upgrade their team in any way possible, and this trade I think is the prime opportunity to do so.

Part of this is because the 2024 draft picks are near their peak value right now. Draft picks usually lose immediately after they are made (exhibit A: Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith), so if the Celtics want to maximize the value they get out of these picks, the ideal time to trade these picks are right now or next offseason. There’s no way of knowing who would be available before the draft next year, so if someone that's an incredible fit like Jrue is available right now the Celtics should take it. And if the Celtics trade both 2024 picks, they will still have all of their draft picks after this season (the 2028 pick swapped with San Antonio is still tradeable).

2 1sts + Pritchard + Hauser at its core I think is a fair offer. But, if its not, part of the reason I think the Celtics will still get Holiday is they have a ton of picks (around 15 1st and 2nd rounders total) they can keep throwing into the deal to outbid most other teams, as many candidates like the Clippers and Warriors only have a few tradeable picks.

**Expanding it to a 3 team trade**

I pitched a direct Celtics/Blazers trade because it was the easiest to reason about, but a 3rd team could easily be roped in to help facilitate this deal for Boston, specifically by trading for Brogdon.

The clear candidate for this would be the Clippers. They were willing to trade a high 2nd round pick and expiring salary for Brogdon, and mainly backed out because they couldn’t get a medical before executing the trade. If that same transaction were looped into this trade with expiring salary and a high 2nd round pick going to the Blazers, that’s one less draft pick the Celtics have to include.

(This table assumes Jrue Holiday will opt into his 24-25 player option, Tatum will sign a supermax extension, and Derrick White will sign his max allowable extension)

|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Second Apron Line|$182,794,000|$201,073,400|$221,180,740|

The financial ramifications are pretty big to consider when making this trade. In trading for Jrue, the Celtics would be going past about $8 million past the second apron for the next 2 seasons, and more than $25 million above the luxury line for a very expensive roster. However, this is in the ballpark of what contenders are paying, so I think it's reasonable to expect ownership to foot this type of bill if they want to win Banner 18.

|Team|Total Cap (not incl tax)|Amount Above Second Apron|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Warriors|$207,244,576|$25,450,576|
|Clippers|$194,134,827|$11,340,827|
|Celtics|$190,785,494|$7,991,494|
|Suns|$188,414,699|$6,470,699|
|Bucks|$181,564,962|$1,116,641|

The Celtics would give themselves a solid 2 year window of strong championship contention before extensions for Tatum and White kick in. I think doing this trade would absolutely be worth this 2 year window, especially if we’re mostly giving up picks for 2024/2025.

In the scenario above, one option would be to let Holiday walk in 2025, when he would enter his age 35 season. Not the ideal solution, but it would help reset the books and have a manageable cap figure for 2025 and beyond. They could also sign-and-trade him, take back a salary in the $10-15 million range, get back some assets to make up for what was given out in the initial trade, still get back below the second apron.

It’s worth mentioning that the more likely scenario, given what other players of Holiday’s stature/age have done, is that Holiday declines the player option and signs a 3 or 4 year extension instead. A 3 yr extension would cover Holiday’s age 34-36 seasons, and he’s still playing at a high level right now with a game that will age well, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he got something like 3/$100 million, especially given the demand for his services right now. Here are some quick projections for what the Celtics salary totals would look like given that.

||23-24|24-25|25-26|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Holiday deal|$36,861,707|*$30,000,000*|*$33,000,000*|
|Celtics Cap Total|$190,785,494|$200,247,267|$234,442,130|
|Luxury Tax|$65,959,911|$39,979,402|$106,236,571|
|Celtics Final Total|$256,745,405|$240,226,669|$340,678,701|

As you can see, the problem again arises in the 2025-2026 season when we will have Brown/Tatum supermaxes and likely a White extension. I do think this salary figure would be too high for ownership, and likely one of White/Holiday/Porzingis/Williams at this point would have to be moved for a cheaper player. But this is a problem like 3 seasons from now, and a lot can change over 2 seasons, so I still think the best course of action would be to maximize the present of this team for the next 2 years and then figure out what players would need to be moved later on if needed. In this case it would most likely be a 35 year old Holiday being moved anyways. Hell, if the Celtics do win a championship and ascend to the most popular team in Boston, maybe ownership will foot that bill.

A last bit I’ll touch on is the fact that we will be going into the second apron for this trade. At the beginning, there seemed like a massive push for the Celtics to get under the second apron, most exemplified by the Grant Williams trade. However, listening to Brad Stevens at press conferences, the big thing he harped on was the fact that it was more about maintaining flexibility and giving themselves the optionality to make future moves. And I would argue this is the exact type of trade/move that you keep that flexibility for, as you're acquiring a All-Star caliber player. If they trade for Jrue they’ll be above the second apron, but the starting lineup would be so good with no major weaknesses that I think you could consider it the “endgame” roster, and you don’t need to make any more moves outside of a couple vet min signings.

Another really funny thing - the framework of the trade I’m suggesting would not have been possible had we re-signed Grant Williams. We would have been over the second apron, meaning we could not accept more salary in a trade than we send out, and we would have to give up one of Horford/Rob Williams to match Jrue’s salary, making this a much less feasible trade for us. So if we do end landing Jrue Holiday, then the decision not to pay Grant Williams and stay out of the second apron ends up being a very savvy move that pays off by President Brad Stevens.

**Basketball reasons**

And now for the fun part, the main reason I think the Celtics will go all-in on Jrue is for his play on the court. He is not only a good passer that can facilitate for Tatum and Brown, but also a good shooter that can play off of them. His defining characteristic is incredible on-ball defense that can fill the void left by Marcus Smart’s departure. He is both a strong and intelligent defender, allowing him to guard both guards and wings. He is the perfect fit for this Celtics core and fits seamlessly in the starting lineup. Holiday/White/Brown/Tatum/Porzingis is a monster unit where everyone brings great shooting and defense in addition to their other unique skills.

On top of that, he has all the intangibles that you could want in a player. I mean seriously, this guy has won Teammate of the Year THREE times, for two different teams. In a league of 500ish players with many outspoken superstars that is a serious accomplishment. When I’ve heard Brad Stevens talk about how he operates as an executive, the things he most commonly harps on are bringing in guys that are skilled, impact winning at a high level, and are of high character. Few players in the league model this more than Jrue, which is why I think Brad will be aggressive in trying to acquire him.

I could go on and on describing Holiday’s game and how much of an upgrade he is over Brogdon/Smart, but I’ll turn to the quantitative metrics to really show you.

First, what Jrue Holiday averaged per 36 minutes last year vs our core guards.

|Player 22-23|PTS/36|AST/36|TO/36|TS%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Holiday|21.3|8.2|3.2|58.6|
|Brogdon|20.6|5.1|2.0|61.5|
|Smart|12.9|7.0|2.6|53.8|
|White|15.8|5.0|1.5|60.4|

Jrue Holiday is more dynamic and well-rounded than any of the guards we had last year. He combines their best attributes - he can give you Brogdon’s scoring and efficiency alongside Smart’s defense and playmaking.

Traditional counting stats only paint a small picture of Holiday’s total impact, as advanced metrics really highlight Holiday’s total impact on winning.

&#x200B;

|Player Stat|RAPM 20-23|RAPTOR|LEBRON|EPM|DPM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Holiday|4.8|5.5|3.47|4.9|4.6|
|Brogdon|1.41|1.8|0.48|0.2|0.1|
|Smart|1.54|0.9|0.9|1.7|1.3|
|White|2.84|5.0|2.41|3.7|1.5|

The further right a column is, the more respected that advanced stat is.

|Player Rank|RAPM 20-23|RAPTOR|LEBRON|EPM|DPM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Holiday|4|15|18|22|6|
|Brogdon|84|65|109|132|134|
|Smart|75|97|83|71|66|
|White|30|18|37|31|57|

As you can see, basically every advanced metric grades Holiday as a top 25 All-Star caliber player, as his overall contributions as an offensive orchestrator and defensive force are captured by these metrics. There is a very significant difference between him and Brogdon, who is graded as more of a high-end bench player/low-end starter. He would also be a big upgrade over his predecessor Smart, who played at the level of an average starter last year.

A backcourt of Holiday and White would be a fantastic combination of size, shooting, defense, and playmaking where both guys would contribute to winning at the level of a borderline All-Star next to Tatum and Brown. This is evident by their net rating and on/off differential last year (which is partly why advanced metrics grade them highly). The Bucks had a net rating of +9.3 with Holiday on the court and -2.5 without him, and the Celtics had a net rating of +10.7 with White on the court and +0.9 without him. The Celtics were actually better in the minutes that Smart/Brogdon were not on the court

|Player 22-23|Net Rating|On/Off Differential|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Holiday|\+9.3|\+12.8|
|Brogdon|\+5.1|\-2.7|
|Smart|\+5.9|\-1.4|
|White|\+10.7|\+9.8|

You may think that this may be statistical noise tied to Holiday playing with Giannis a lot, a dive into the stats suggested otherwise.

|Bucks Player Combo|Minutes|Net Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Both on|1222|\+13.41|
|Giannis on/Jrue off|801|\-1.84|
|Giannis off/Jrue on|960|\+5.15|
|Both off|982|\-6.31|

As you can see, Jrue managed to have better impact in terms of pure net rating than even Giannis last year, as the Bucks were +5.15 in Jrue-only minutes and -1.84 in Giannis-only minutes

**The competition**

The last main reason I think a Jrue Holiday deal will truly happen is because the competition to get him, at least before the season starts, may be less fierce than you would initially anticipate.

The quick list of teams I don’t will be in the Jrue sweepstakes, either because they

* don’t have the assets
* don’t have good matching salary as of now
* don’t have players the Blazers would want to take on
* would not be willing to part with certain high level prospects/players to get him
* are guard-heavy or not competing this year and wouldn’t benefit from add Holiday

76ers, Cavaliers, Pistons, Bucks, Wizards, Hawks, Heat, Timberwolves, Blazers, Lakers, Suns, Kings, Grizzlies, Rockets (14 teams)

To elaborate on two teams in this:

The 76ers have been considered by others as a possibility for a Harden/Holiday swap, but I really don’t see it. Harden would have to be redirected to a 3rd team by the Blazers… and that 3rd team could easily just trade for Holiday themselves. Why would you risk trading for a malcontent who has requested 3 trades in 4 years when you can just acquire the 3 time Teammate of the Year instead?

The Heat I think just have a very sour relationship with the Blazers front office at this point so I don’t see the two sides negotiating on good terms.

&#x200B;

I’ll put will put the remaining teams in some quick tiers:

*Tier 4: Teams That Are Too Young To Go All-In and Likely Won’t Engage In A Bidding War*

Magic, Hornets, Spurs

All these teams have the assets to get Holiday, but given he’s 33, I think it’s unlikely these teams pay a significant price to get him given how young their core players are

*Tier 3: Teams That Have The Assets and Could Acquire Him but Are Unlikely To*

Nets, Jazz, Pelicans

The Nets lack quality guard depth and have some good draft picks, but many of them are 2027 and beyond. I think they will value the potential upside of these picks (Suns and Mavericks future picks) over acquiring a 33 year old now. I would put the Jazz in the same boat.

The Pelicans traded away Holiday a few seasons ago, so I don’t see them going back to acquire an older version of him.

*Tier 2: Dark Horse Candidates*

Raptors, Pacers, Mavericks, Nuggets

The Raptors I think could be in for Jrue, he fits their defensive identity and they are shallow at PG. However, they don’t have their 2024 1st round pick, so any deal would likely center around Trent Jr + far future firsts. Given how stingy Masai is in negotiations, I don’t see him giving up multiple 1sts in a deal like this, but it could happen.

The Mavericks could go after Jrue, as they’ve reportedly had interest in him in the past. Although they only have 1 tradable 1st round pick right now, they have matching salary and an interesting piece in Josh Green that could swing a deal if included. Ultimately, I think it’s a lower chance because they already have two high quality guards in Luke and Kyrie, and they would benefit more from adding a solid starting center than another guard.

The Pacers are another dark horse team that could be in for Jrue. They have 2 1st round picks this upcoming draft to trade, so it’s lower risk for them compared to the Raptors/Mavericks. A Haliburton/Holiday backcourt would be interesting, but ultimately I don’t see them getting in a bidding war with other contenders.

The Nuggets could also look to swap into their championship winning team, and any trade would likely be built around Michael Porter Jr for salary matching purposes. While there’s a small chance the Blazers could be really high on him, I think it's unlikely. He has almost $150 million left on his deal for the next 4 years and has lingering injury issues, so I think the Blazers are more likely to go with a deal that involves less risk given how many options they’ll have.

*Tier 1: The Real Threats*

Thunder, Knicks, Clippers, Bulls, Warriors

The Thunder have one of the biggest draft pick war chests they could pull from to get Jrue Holiday, a bunch of filler salary to match, and could include Lu Dort if they’re willing to part with him. A Holiday-SGA-J. Williams-Giddey-Holmgren lineup would be pretty dynamic and exciting. However, all the reports from the Thunder front office seem to suggest they want to build slowly and not rush into short-term moves, so it's possible they save their chips and see what they have this year first before making any big moves.

The Knicks similarly have a plethora of 1st round picks to trade in a deal like this, and they have matching salary in Evan Fournier and a few other pieces without having to give up any of their core players. Jrue seems likely a perfect Thibodeau player so I could see the Knicks going hard after him. The only question would be if the Knicks are willing to pay significant draft capital for a 33 year old or if they want to hold out to trade for a younger star like Donovan Mitchell.

The Clippers have less draft picks to trade, but they can trade their 2028 and 2030 1st round picks as well as some pick swaps and expiring salaries for filler. The question with them is whether they are willing to risk trading away draft picks that far in the future, especially given the uncertainty about their current team. They are already missing two picks and a swap over the next 3 years: do they want to dig their heels deeper into this team when Leonard/George are in their mid 30s and Leonard can’t seem to stay healthy for a few games in a row without getting hurt? If they do, then it’s possible the Blazers would value high-upside Clippers picks over low-upside Celtics picks, but I have my doubts as to whether they will make all those picks available.

The Bulls have been reported as a potential Jrue Holiday destination, and they are an interesting spot. They have control over a protected Blazers pick which would be convenient for the Blazers to get back and they have all of their own 1st round picks except for 2025. I doubt they’d be willing to trade multiple 1st round picks in the future, but the piece that could really swing this deal for them is Patrick Williams. Williams was the #4 overall pick in 2020, a wing prospect who hasn’t quite made a big impact for the Bulls yet. He’s still pretty young going into his age 22 season and has one year left on his rookie contract. If the Bulls make him available that would be a very enticing offer for the Blazers that would be hard for the Celtics to beat, but again there’s uncertainty if Bulls would make him available.

The Warriors are the final team here and probably our main competitor for Holiday. They are more in contention than the other teams in this tier, and seem to be aggressive in trying to win a 5th ring with their core having traded away young players like Jordan Poole and James Wiseman for veterans Chris Paul and Gary Payton II. Chris Paul would likely be rerouted in this deal, and they can only trade 2 of their future 1st round picks, but they could also include 2021 #7 overall pick Jonathan Kuminga or #14 overall pixk Moses Moody as interesting prospects for the Trail Blazers. The question in that case would be if the difference between Chris Paul and Jrue Holiday is worth giving up a prospect like Kuminga… and I’m leaning no especially since the Warriors seems to be very high on him. It’s also possible the Blazers would value 2026 and 2028 1st round picks from the Warriors as more valuable than picks from the Celtics, which could drive up the price for the Celtics.

Overall I think the Celtics would be willing to outbid these teams with all the 1st round picks they have, but if prospects like Patrick Williams and Jonathan Kuminga are made available then that would be tough for the Celtics to beat.

**Conclusion**

While each of the reasons I have listed above are minor pieces that could motivate a Jrue trade, I think the combination of all of them together (being able to trade for him without giving up Horford/Williams, this being the best time to trade 2024 picks, being able to afford him for at least 2 seasons, his perfect basketball fit, the small amount of real threats to outbid us) is leading me to think this trade will really happen. And also the strokes of luck that this trade framework would not be possible with Grant Williams on the roster, and the fact that Blake Griffin hasn’t signed with a team yet.

Is it actually a near lock? Probably not. The Celtics are the betting favorite to land him at +250, but that’s far from a lock. I guess I’m just trying to speak it into existence"

Derrick White: came off the bench today, played good minutes at the beginning of the second half as the US overcame a 16 point second-quarter deficit. Stat sheet might seem rather empty but was playing some elite-level defense (as usual)

Thoughts on the Jrue, JT, and DWhite's performances today?"
93,"(Himmelsbach) There were reports that Celtics senior consultant Jeff Van Gundy might replace Charles Lee, who was hired to coach Charlotte. But according to a league source, both sides agreed it would be best for Van Gundy to accept an offer to become the Clippers’ top assistant.","The Celtics, the source said, were somewhat uneasy about the prospect of Van Gundy leapfrogging members of the coaching staff who had been instrumental in this championship season, and Van Gundy agreed. But there is unanimous sentiment that Van Gundy was an invaluable sounding board for the young staff this season.

Look for the Celtics to fill Lee’s position by promoting from within.

94,Signing Jrue Holiday to that contract may be a sign that Derrick White will stay with us.,"To start things off, we still have Derrick White's Bird Rights (if memory serves me correct, but please correct me if I'm wrong). But that's not why Derrick White resigning with us is guaranteed imo. We all know that Brad Stevens and Wyc talks a lot behind the scenes. Wyc has emphasized that he's willing to pay the money if the team are contenders and can win a championship. Which leads me to my point. Brad Stevens must've convinced Wyc that he needs to pay Derrick White the money that he wants, regardless of whether the team win the championship or not. And Wyc gave him the green light to sign Jrue Holiday that money, because he's willing to shelve out more money for D White, even with the second apron being in play. We all know that our title window will most likely end if D White leaves. I truly don't believe that he's reached his peak yet, which is crazy to say given that he's going to turn 30. 

I don't know, this is just my theory, and my wishful thinking may be clouding my judgment. But no one here expected us to extend a soon-to-be 34 year old Jrue Holiday to that contract, when we all know D White is the priority over him. My assumption is that Brad Stevens and Wyc are in agreement that Derrick White WILL be resigned to an extension, hence why Wyc is willing to shell out the money for a past his prime Jrue Holiday, who probably has at max 2 good years left in him. 

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this?"
95,TRADE DEADLINE THOUGHTS?,"Defense was the name of the game for Brad Stevens — Jaden Springer and Xavier Tillman are good on that side of the ball.   Springer is a feisty guard, while Tillman is an insurance policy and big body inside."

97,Our PnR defense is broken,"This film breakdown pretty clearly illustrates the flaws in our defensive scheme/execution that led to countless wide open threes for Miami. Our drop coverage was atrocious and (Jrue was the main culprit of this) we need to be better about staying home on shooters.

If you’ve never seen this guy’s work before, just know he’s like this for every team; his titles and tone are hilariously over the top but the film breakdown is always on point "
